<span class="pagetitle">COMP 2140 Data Structures and Algorithms<br>Lab 4</span>
<br>The week of March 9

<p><b>Objectives</b>
<br>
</p><ul>
  <li> To implement part of a binary search tree deletion method.</li>
  <li> To implement a binary search tree print method.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<b>Exercise:
</b><br>
<a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/%7Ecomp2140/Labs/BST.java">BST.java</a> 
contains an incomplete binary search tree implementation.
<ul>
  <li>The <tt>main</tt> method constructs a tree without the use of an
insert algorithm --- it simply links nodes directly together. </li>
<li> The <tt>main</tt> method calls a <tt>BST</tt> <tt>printInorder</tt>
method multiple times. Implement this method using an in-order traversal of the tree.</li>
  <li> The <tt>main</tt> method also calls a <tt>BST</tt> <tt>delete</tt>
method multiple times. </li>
    <li>The body of the <tt>delete</tt> method has been provided to
you.&nbsp; We have provided the code to deal the cases where the
node to be deleted has&nbsp; no children and one children.&nbsp; You
will write the code that deals with deleting a node with two children,
which is handled by the method <tt>deleteTwoChildren</tt>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Write the <tt>deleteTwoChildren </tt>method body, using the algorithm
described
in class
(to delete a node with two children, replace the node with its inorder
successor).
That is, your code will first find the inorder successor of the node to
be deleted, copy its data into the node to be delete and then delete
the inorder successor node.&nbsp; To aid you, we have provided comments
on what you need to do in the method.&nbsp; Refer to your class notes
if you have any questions. <br>
<br>
You should change <b>nothing else</b> in the <tt>BST.java</tt>
file --- you should only add the <tt>deleteTwoChildren</tt> and <tt>printInorder</tt> method bodies.
