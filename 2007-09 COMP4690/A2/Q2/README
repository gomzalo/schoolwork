My branch prediction simulator is written in C++.  To compile, use g++ as normal:
  g++ branch_predict.cpp -o branch_predict

The number of bits per branch history table entry and the number of entries are #defines in the .cpp file, so to test out different values, you will have to change those lines in branch_predict.cpp and recompile.

To run, you must pass in the tracefile as command line arguments, as such:
  branch_predict [trace file]
For example, to run the branch predictor on the tracefile called branchTrace.txt the correct command is:
  branch_predict branchTrace.txt

Results.xls contains the output graphed to show trends, and some comments.  Output contains the output from all the various input test cases.
