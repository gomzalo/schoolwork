To compile the program, use g++; the preferred syntax would be g++ -o harvard harvard.cpp, to create an executable named 'harvard'.

Then, run the program with harvard [object file] [data file].  Note that the object file must have a .o extension.  The data file can have any extension.  The program will still run if a data file is not passed to it.
