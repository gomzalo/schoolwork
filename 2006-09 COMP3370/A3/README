COMP 3370 Assignment 3 - DMA Sim
Trevor Bekolay, 6796723

The last assignment!  I hope you're enjoying marking these, they look like they take a long time.
Anyway, I'll be brief about my assignment then!  My code is in dma_sim.cpp.  After you run the program once, a 'hard_drive' file
will be created, containing the contents of the "hard drive". Do a simple g++ dma_sim.cpp to compile the code.  Then, to run the pre-assembled files, do:
a.out (or whatever you named it) test1.o test1-x.dat
a.out test2.o test2.dat
This will show you what the programs do for various inputs.
