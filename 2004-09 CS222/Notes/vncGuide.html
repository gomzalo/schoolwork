<p>The <tt>vnc</tt> system works through an internet browser and provides 
an X-Windows terminal. It means that you can run an <tt>X-Windows</tt> terminal 
from anywhere in the world! You can find more information on <tt>vnc</tt> 
at <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/"> AT&amp;T Laboratories Cambridge</a></p>
            
<h3>Starting a vnc session </h3>
            
<ol>
              <li>                                    Start up a telnet client
   (for   example, SSH) and <tt>login</tt> to your <tt>UNIX</tt> account. 
The host  you   want is <tt>ccu.umanitoba.ca</tt>.     Enter your userID and
password.      </li>
              <li>    Create a password that you will use to connect to 
  your       <tt>vnc</tt> desktop session with the command <tt>vncpasswd</tt>. 
      It will prompt   you for your password, then get you to type it again 
  for    verification.   You only need to create your password once, but if
  you    forget it you will  have to create a new one using the <tt>vncpasswd</tt> 
command    again.        </li>
              <li>    Start your remote desktop session using the command 
    <tt>vncserver</tt>.          The response to this command will look something 
like this:                                                              
 
    <pre>New 'X' desktop is merak:5</pre>
                plus some other information. This response contains the name
  of  a  server      and a port number that you will use to connect to your
  desktop   session.      The server may be any of the Computer Centre login
  servers  like     <tt>pollux</tt>,      <tt>mira</tt>, etc.        </li>
              <li>    Start a web browser. Make sure Java is enabled. Type
 in  the   <tt>URL</tt>  for    your desktop session using the server and 
port information   given   by  the    <tt>vncserver</tt> command. For example, 
for the server   and port   information     above, the correct <tt>URL</tt> 
is:                                                                
    <pre>http://merak.cc.umanitoba.ca:5805</pre>
                Your <tt>URL</tt> should look exactly like this, except for 
the server   name   and      the last 2 digits and notice the insertion of 
a <tt>58</tt>.         </li>
              <li>    You will see a page with the title <tt> VNC Authentication</tt> 
and a     text box labelled <tt>Password:</tt>. Enter the password you created 
     in     step 2 and click OK. The browser will then start your <tt>X-Windows</tt> 
 desktop        session. Note that you probably won't be able to see your 
entire     desktop in the browser window, so if it looks like something's 
missing    from your desktop, scroll to the bottom of the window.     </li>
            
</ol>
 
<h3>Finishing your vnc session</h3>
      
<ol>
   <li>When you are finished your work, you should close down your desktop 
    session. To do this, scroll to the top of the browser window. At the top
     left hand corner you will find the <tt>Disconnect</tt> button. Click
 it  to   end your desktop session. You are still logged into <tt>ccu.umanitoba.ca</tt> 
and you need to kill the desktop session there.</li>
   <li>On the command  line type (with the appropriate machine name - <tt>antares</tt>
is used here):   <tt>vncserver -kill antares:6</tt> . If you forget the number
   and name do a <tt>ps</tt> to  get the process name  and kill it with <tt>kill
   -9 #</tt>, where <tt>#</tt> is the process number. If you do not kill
the    session, it will be available at the web site for later use.  Letting
a      <tt>vnc</tt> session continue for a few days is very bad as your quota 
will be used up  and then you will have no resources to do anything.<br>
   </li>
 
</ol>
