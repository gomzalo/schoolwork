<h3><align=center> Basic Operation of Sparc Machine Language</h3>
The SPARC is a RISC machine. RISC stands for reduced instruction set
computer.  This means that the number of instructions have been reduced
and standardized for efficiency.  In the SPARC, there is no way to do
anything to data in the memory accept to fetch it or store it. Because of
standardization pipelining is possible.  More on that later on. In
contrast the 68k is a CISC machine which stands for complex instruction
set machine. 


<p> The control unit executes instructions from top to bottom.  The Fetch
And Execute cycle have already been described. All instructions are
32 bits long and most of them are executed in one time unit or machine
cycle.


<h3><align=center> HARDWARE MODEL </h3>
<h4>Memory</h4>
<ul>
<li> Addresses are 32 bits in SPARC
<LI> Each BYTE=8 bits has its own address.
<LI> Half Word = 16 bits, not used much
<LI> Word = 32 bits 
<LI> Bit 0 is least significant (rightmost) bit. Bit 7/15/31 is most
signifcant for various sizes
<LI> The 2/4/8 bytes of a thing are stored in consecutive memory
locations using Big Endian.<BR>
</ul>


<H5> Boundary Alignment </H5>
SPARC- 2/4/8 entities <b>must </b>be 2/4/8 aligned. Instructions are 
aligned on 0 mod 4 bytes.
The instructions are:
<pre>
   .align  2
   .align  4
   .align  8
</pre>

<H4> Registers</H4>

<P>General Purpose Registers:</P>
There are 32 32bit registers available to you at anyone time.
<br>%g0 - %g7, gloabal registers, %go is always 0. Used as temporary
storage.
<br>%o0 - %o7. output registers
<br>%i0 - %i7 input registers
<br>%L0 - %L7 local registers, use these first
<BR><BR>
%i6,%i7,%o6,%o7 are special by software convention.  They are used for
stacks and subprograms.   


<P>Special Purpose Registers: (available to programmer) </P>

<UL>
  <LI>PC (Program Counter) same as in 68k
  <LI>nPC (Next Program Counter) we will see later.
  <LI>PSR (Process State Register) serves a similar function to the SR of
68k. 
</ul>
<P>There are other registers in the CPU, but these are not visible to the
assembly language (or machine language) programmer, and are
implementation-dependent.</P>
