Everything you have learned about constructs in SPARC also apply to 68k.  But
there are special looping constructs in 68k much like a PASCAL For
statement or a Fortran DO statement.  We will study and use only one type.




<H2>The DBRA Instruction 68000k </H2>

<UL>
  <LI>The syntax of the dbra (decrement and branch) instruction is
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>dbra  Di,Addr</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>This instruction decrements Di.w and branches to Addr if the result
  is not -1.
  <LI>It is the equivalent of the following 3 instructions
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>sub.w #1,Di
cmp.w #-1,Di
bne   Addr</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>This is a very typical CISC (COMPLEX INSTRUCTION SET 
COMPUTER) instruction. In a program for a RISC machine,
you would use the three separate instructions.
  <LI>Its purpose is to make &quot;count-controlled loops&quot; easier. (That
  is, if you know in advance exactly how many times a loop should execute,
  use this instruction.)
  <LI>To execute a loop exactly N times, use this code:
 </UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>      move.w N,D2 ;Get N into a D reg, if not there already
      bra    EndL ;Start at the dbra instruction at the bottom
Loop: ...
      ...
EndL: dbra   D2,Loop</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>This is the &quot;right&quot; kind of loop, with only one branch in
  it, at the bottom. The loop is entered by branching to the &quot;dbra&quot;
  at the bottom.
  <LI>This also explains why the dbra instruction checks for -1 and not 0.
  <LI>If you want to use the values in the register , they are
   N-1,N-2,...1,0. 
 <LI>Here are two incorrect ways to do it:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>      move.w N,D1
Loop: ...
      ...
      dbra   D1,Loop</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>The above loop executes N+1 times, not N times.
  <LI>OK, so how about decrementing N first to fix that problem?
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>      move.w  N,D1
      sub.w  #1,D1
Loop: ...
      ...
      dbra   D1,Loop</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>The above loop contains a <B>huge</B> bug. If N=0 the loop will not
  be executed 0 times (which is correct). Instead, it will be executed 65536
  times!! (The first time through, the &quot;dbra&quot; will decrement -1
  and get -2. This is not -1 so it will keep going. The value in D1 will
  have to count all the way down to -32768, overflow up to +32767, and continue
  down until it finally reaches -1 the hard way.)
  <LI>Beware of quick fixes!!
</UL>
