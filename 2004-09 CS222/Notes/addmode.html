<h2>
Addressing Modes</h2></center>
There are 12 modes in 68000 and 18 modes in 68020-68040.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
1) Absolute Long</h3>
It specifies a 24/32 bit address directly.&nbsp; The data is read or written
to that address.
<br>Eg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOVE.W&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;$A56C20, D3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copies contents of address
A56C20, A56C21 to D3.W
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;MOVE.W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JUNK,D3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copies contents of address JUNK to D3.W
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;MOVE.W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JUNK+2,D3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;copies contents of address JUNK+2 and address JUNK+3 i.e. the
same thing can be done with:
<pre>
       MOVE.W  OTHER,D3
</pre>
<br>JUNK:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DS.W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
<br>OTHER: DS.W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;1
<p>The last two examples are quite common with programmers but real
assemblers always translate "absolute long" to a PC-relative mode.
(relocability problems).

<h3>
2) Absolute Short</h3>
It specifies a 16 bit address, sign extended to 24/32 bits.&nbsp; This
gives addresses in 0000-7FFF lowest 32K&nbsp; memory and
<br>FFFF8000-FFFFFFFF highest 32K memory.&nbsp; These areas often contain
special system data which the operating system does not want wiped
out.&nbsp; Do <b><u>NOT</u></b> use.
<br>Eg. MOVE.W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2F3C.W,D2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOVE.W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
JUNK.W, D2
<br>W refers to size of data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
W refers to size of address
<br>If JUNK had address 0001A800 the effective address is FFFFA800.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>3) Data Register Direct</h3>
It specifies a data register (i.e. D).  Syntax Di
<BR><pre>Eg.  MOVE.W	 D3,D4    copies register D3 into register
D4</pre>
   
<h3>4) Address Register Direct</h3>
It specifies an address(A) register.
<PRE>Eg.	MOVE.L 	A3,D4 </pre>   
copies A3 into D4.  Does not access memory.

<h3>5) Immediate</h3>
It specifies data that is embedded in the instruction.  Syntax #value.
<pre>
Eg.
MOVE.L 		#$A56C20,D3   copies $00A56C20 into D3
whereas
MOVE.L 		$A56C20,D3    copies contents of memory at A56C20 into D3

MOVE.W 		JUNK,D3       copies contents of memory at JUNK into D3
whereas
MOVE.W 		#JUNK,D3      copies address JUNK into D3
</pre>
In a real system the last instruction would not be allowed due to
relocatibility problems.  It works fine on the Simulator but use 
<pre>
LEA             JUNK,D3  
</pre>

<h3>6) 7) 8) Address Register Indirect (with postincrement/predecrement)</h3>
It specifies the contents of memory at an address contained in an A
register. Syntax <pre> (Ai)  or  (Ai)+  or   -(Ai)</pre>
(Ai)+  increments Ai by the size of DATA after using the address<br>
-(Ai)  decrements Ai by the size of DATA before using the address
<br><br>
Useful for stacks and arrays.  You can get easy sequential access to data
items in consecutive memory locations.
<BR><BR>
<pre>
Eg.
Suppose A5 contains 00ABCDE0
Suppose memory is address   content
                  ABCDDE    0000
                  ABCDE0    1234
                  ABCDE2    5678
then
MOVE.W	(A5),D3   	moves 1234 into D3.W
MOVE.W  (A5)+,D4	moves 1234 into D4.W, then increments A5 by 2
MOVE.W  (A5)+,D6        moves 5678 into D6.W, then increments A5 by 2
MOVE.W  -(A5),D3	decrements A5 by 2, then moves 5678 into D3
MOVE.W  -(A5),D4	decrements A5 by 2, then moves 1234 into D4
MOVE.W  -(A5),D2        decrements A5 by 2, then moves 0000 into D2
</pre><br>

<h3>9)Address Register Indirect with Displacement</h3>
It refers to contents of memory at address formed by adding a displacement
to contents of An.  Syntax: disp(An) or modern assemblers accept (disp,Ai).
The displacement is a 16 bit 2's complement signed integer constant that is 
embedded in the instruction.
<pre>
Eg.
If A3 contains $00ABC000 then
MOVE.W  $0F3(A3),D3   will copy the word at address $00ABC0F3 into
D3.W
MOVE.L  -1(A3),D1     will copy the long at address $00ABBFFF into D1.L
</pre>
It is used for many data structures like structures and records.  It
is used for accessing portions of any block of memory whose location
(first byte) is stored in a register.  It is used a lot.

<h3>10) Address Register indirect with Index</h3>
disp(An,Rn) accesses the memory at (An+disp+Rn).  Rn is the index and may
be D or A register.  Although complicated it is useful.

<h3>11) & 12) Program Counter Addressing Modes.</h3>  
Not really used much by programmers but necessary for relocatability.  
More later. 
<p>Note that this gives access to memory  + or - 32K from an
address in An.  This is the reason for many 32K byte limits on blocks of
data.  Eg. local variables in THINK Pascal.


<H3>Allowable modes</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Every instruction (opcode) will separately specify the addressing mode(s)
  which are allowed for its operands.
  <LI>Most instructions will accept most combinations of reasonable modes,
  but there are exceptions. (Example: for the &quot;add&quot; instruction
  one operand must be a D register, and the destination cannot be an A register.)
  <LI>An important point:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Only the above modes are allowed. All operands must have a syntax
  which EXACTLY matches one of these modes. The &quot;Ai&quot;, &quot;Di&quot;,
  and &quot;const&quot; values must be exactly that. They are not general-purpose
  &quot;expressions&quot; as used in high-level languages.</B></P>
  <PRE>move.w 47(A3),D4 ;OK
move.w 47(D3),D3 ;no such mode - invalid
move.w D3(A3),D2 ;no such mode - invalid
move.w (A4+3),D1 ;no such mode - invalid
move.w 3+2(A4),D0 ;OK because &quot;3+2&quot; is still a &quot;constant&quot;</PRE>
