<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Assembler Directives</H2>

<p><h4><b>1. Source Code Control</b></h4>
In SPARC machines, the code and data are usually stored
separately. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>.section &quot;.text&quot;  !the following lines are instructions
.section &quot;.data&quot;  !the following lines are data</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Although it is common to have all of the code at the beginning and all
of the data at the end, it is preferable in many cases to interleave them,
to improve readability. For example,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>! Print a heading

      set  head,%o0
      call printf
      nop

! Here's the heading

      .section &quot;.data&quot;  !switch to data
head: .asciz   &quot;The solution is:\n&quot;
      .section &quot;.text&quot;  !switch back to code again

! Now continue processing

      add  %g0,%g0,%L4  !Initialize count to 0.</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>2. Boundary Alignment</H4>

In SPARC, use</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>.align  N</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where N is 2, 4, 8, or 16, to indicate that the next item should be placed
at an address that is a multiple of N.  Use ".align   4" to align the
instructions.</P>


<H4>3. Storage Allocation</H4>

<P>To allocate uninitialized storage for variables, use</P>
<pre>
   .skip N ;allocate N bytes of uninitialized storage</PRE>
</pre>

<P>To place particular initial values in memory (constants or initialized
variables) use</P>

<pre>
   .byte  value,value,... ;Each value occupies 1 byte
   .half  value,value,... ;Each value occupies 2 bytes
   .word  value,value,... ;Each value occupies 4 bytes
   .ascii 'characters..'  ;Each ascii character occupies a byte
   .asciz 'characters..'  ;Each ascii character occupies a byte,
                          ;and a null byte (0) is added at the end.</PRE>
</pre>


<H4>4. Symbol Definition</H4>

<P>In any assembler, symbols (identifiers) may be defined in two ways:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>By using a symbol as a label, it stands for the address into which
  the following code or data will be placed (the value of the &quot;location
  counter&quot;).
  <LI>By defining a symbol and giving it a value directly. 
  <TT>symbol = value<BR>
  </TT>where the &quot;value&quot; may be any constant, or any expression
  which combines constants to give a constant answer. The character 
  &quot;.&quot; stands for the address into  which the following code or
  data will be placed (the value of the &quot;location counter&quot;).  In
  real 68k this is possible using the character &quot;*&quot;, but this
  seems not to have been implemented in our 68k assembler. </OL>


<P> 
Symbolic constants are not allowed in the expressions in  the data
section.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>	
TheArray:  .skip  4*10 ;Each element takes 4 bytes
size       =      .-TheArray
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The last statement is not used much in SPARC.

<h2>Standard Library Routines</h2>

USE:
<pre>CALL    NAME</pre> to call any subporogram from the standard
C-language library.  Before execution of the "call", place the parameters
in registers %o0, %o1,..%o5.  This will handle 97% of calls.  The other 3% we
will deal with later.  Remember  that "call" is a branch instruction and
it has a delay slot so fill it.
Remember to assemble your program properly use:
<pre>  cc  Mycode.s MASlib.c</pre>

<P>Here is a short description of the available routines:</P>

<P><TABLE WIDTH="450" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0" HEIGHT=
"355">
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="24%" HEIGHT="17"><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;<B>Name</B></TD>
<TD WIDTH="76%"><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Purpose</B></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">newline</TD>
<TD>Write a newline character. Start a new output line.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">decin</TD>
<TD>Read a decimal integer, store it in %o0</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">hexin</TD>
<TD>Read a hexadecimal integer, store it in %o0</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">decout</TD>
<TD>Write the integer in %o0 in decimal</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">hexout</TD>
<TD>Write the integer in %o0 in hexadecimal</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="30">strout</TD>
<TD>Write the string whose address is in %o0. Write characters until a null
character (ascii code 0) is encountered.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="69">strin</TD>
<TD>Read in a string of characters into a &quot;buffer&quot; (place in memory)
whose address is in %o0, Reading stops when a newline character is read
(it is not stored in the buffer).  The null terminator is stored in the
buffer automatically. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">charout</TD>
<TD>Write out the character whose ascii code is in %o0</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">charin</TD>
<TD>Read in the next character and put it in %o0. EOF is indicated if %o0 =
0xFFFFFFFF = -1.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">memdump</TD>
<TD>Write out the memory contents starting at address in %o0 and going
for  %o1 bytes.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
