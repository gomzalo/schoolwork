<h3>Some useful UNIX commands: (compiled by Adam Knibbs, 2 June 2003)</h3>
<b>cd</b> this is used to change directory. <br>
<br>
<b>cd </b><i><b>directory</b></i> will put you into the directory called
<b><i>directory</i> </b><br>
<br>
<b>cd ..</b> this will bring you back one level in your directory  <br>
<br>
<b>man <i>command</i></b> this will allow you to look at the manual (man)
for any command that you type in.  If this does not bring up any information
the command might be an alias for another one.   <br>
<br>
<b>pwd </b> this command will tell you where you are by <b>p</b>rinting <b>w</b>orking
<b>d</b>irectory <br>
<br>
<b>ls </b> this command will list all the files in short form. <br>
<br>
<b>ls -a</b> this command will list all the files including hidden files. 
<br>
<br>
<b>ls -l</b> this command will list all the information about your files,
such as file size  <br>
<br>
<b>ps</b> this lists the process status that you are running (this is useful
if you have a process that has stopped responding) Look for the number(called
the process id or pid for short) that is beside the program that you have
running. Using this with <b>kill</b> will stop the program.  <br>
<br>
<b>kill <i>number</i></b> this is used to kill processes that are not responing.
 Used with the number that you get from <b>ps</b> <br>
<br>
<b>quota -v </b> this will list how much of your space you are using.  Important
if you are getting blank files that should have data in them.
