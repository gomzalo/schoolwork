<h2>Shifts </h2></center>
<pre>
The following instructions cause Dj to be shifted to the left.   The high
order bits disappear except for the last one which can be found in the C
bit.  So it can be tested.  The low order bits are replaced by 0.
The first L stands for Logical and the A stands for Arithmetical.  The S
stands for shift and the second L stands for Left. LSL and ASL are identical.

68K
LSL  Di,Dj  1-31 bits
LSL  #n,Dj  1-8 bits
LSL  &lt;ea&gt;   1 bit
ASL  Di,Dj  1-31 bits
ASL  #n,Dj  1-8 bits
ASL  &lt;ea&gt   1 bit

The following instructions cause Dj to be shifted to the right.   The high
order bits disappear except for the last one which can be found in the C
bit.  So it can be tested.  The R stands for right.  In LSR the high
order bits are replaced by 0 whereas in ASR the high order bits are
replaced by the sign bit.  #n must be a value between 1 and 8 inclusive
in all cases.
LSR  Di,Dj  1-31 bits
LSR  #n,Dj  1-8 bits
LSR  &lt;ea&gt   1 bit
ASR  Di,Dj  1-31 bits
ASR  #n,Dj  1-8 bits
ASR  &lt;ea&gt   1 bit

There is also a rotate command where the high order bits are cycled back
to become the low order bits.  L is left and R is right

ROL  Di,Dj  1-31 bits
ROL  #n,Dj  1-8 bits
ROL  &lt;ea&gt   1 bit
ROR  Di,Dj  1-31 bits
ROR  #n,Dj  1-8 bits
ROR  &lt;ea&gt   1 bit

<h2>Logical Operators </h2></center>
Just as in the SPARC we have logical operators .
<pre>
AND   &lt;ea&gt,Dn     or       AND Dn,&lt;ea&gt
ANDI  #data,Dn
OR    &lt;ea&gt,Dn     or       OR  Dn,&lt;ea&gt
ORI   #data,Dn
EOR   &lt;ea&gt,Dn
EORI  #data,Dn
