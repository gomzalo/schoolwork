<H1 align=center>  SUBROUTINES </h1> 

<h3 general> General </h2>
Subroutines tend to use registers,stack, previously defined memory.  They
tend never to define new storage in memory.
<pa>
Stack - memory at high end of addresses.  It is uses addresses high to
low.  There is a stack pointer to the top of the stack.  The top of the
stack has data in it.
<p>
To use subroutines you must:<BR>
1. Stop what you are doing and store everything subroutine might
clobber.<BR>
2. Solve subroutine problem<BR>
3. Restore the machine to its previous state except for what subroutine is
allowed to clobber.
<p>


Subroutine Linkage<BR>
1. Basic - How to Call, Save return address, How to get back<BR>
2. Saving registers -All Non-volatile registers must be saved, Volatile
registers may be clobbered.<BR>
3. Communication - save parameters and results.  Either registers or stack
or both.<BR>
4. Saving Local Varibles and temporary Storage - on stack



<h3>SPARC</H3>
<h4>BASIC</H4>
1) "call address(name of routine)" saves the address of itself into
the register %o7, branches to the operand address.  This instruction has a
delay slot.  It is equivalent to the following:
<pre>
     set    subprog, %L1
     jumpl  %L1, %o7
</pre>
"jumpl is called jump and link.<br>
2) "jumpl %r1 +{%r2 or const}, %r3" saves the address of itself into %r3
and branches to the address %r1 plus the optional offset const or plus the
optional value in %r2.<br>
"jumpl %i7+8,%go" is the regular instruction for synethetic instruction
"RET" in the epilogue.  Note that %i7 is the name of %o7 in the subroutine
and that %i7 has the address of jumpl in the mainline, %i7+4 is the delay slot
after jumpl and that %i7+8 is the address of the instruction where we want
to return to.  All what the user needs to know is that you call with
"CALL" and return with "RET" and it all works.
 
<h4>Saving Registers</H4>
<ol>
<li>Registers %o7,%o6,%i7,%i6 should only be used for subroutine linkage.
%06 is the stack pointer and %i6 is the frame pointer ( not quite the same
as in 68k).
<li>Volatile Registers %g1-%g7 and %o0-%o7.  Use only as tempoaries within
subroutine.  So %i0-%i7 and %L0-%L7 need saving and restoring.
<li>Mechanism-Every subroutine gets a new set of registers with the "SAVE"
command.  More precisely the following happens.  There is only one set of
g registers and all programs and subprograms use the same set.  The output
registers of the calling program get a new name and are called input
registers of the called program.  Finally a new set of local and output
registers are issued to the subroutine.  Also the stack pointer gets a 
new name called frame pointer and a new stack pointer with an offset
subtracted off it is established.  This is all done by decrementing
the Current Window Pointer(CWP) which takes one CPU cycle to do.  Faster
than any other system.
<li>Instruction- "save~~sp,{const or %reg},sp".  This is a weird
instruction.  In the middle of the "SAVE" instruction the CWP gets
decremented.  The value of the old sp (calling program) + the
offset (either const or in %reg) is passed onto the new sp (called
program).
Of course the fp of the called program gets the value of just the old sp
of the calling program.  The effect is to switch register sets and to save
space on the stack.  <br>
In the prologue we always use -96.  Of those 96 bytes, 64 are used for the
16 4-byte registers (in and local).
<li>Space on Stack-If the program gets interupted (eg. swapped out,
debugger stops it, etc) there must be somewhere to save the registers.
The programmer is responsible for setting up the storage although the
system will do the actual saving.
<li>When are registers saved-<br>
1) "window overflow" - The system runs out of register sets and must use
the stack.  This happens when there are more pending subroutine calls then
register sets.<br>
2) "window underflow" - the sytem is returning fron a subroutine call and
would like to switch back the register sets but the "about-to-be restored"
set has been saved previously because of overflow.  This happens near the
top of the "return".<br>
3)interrupt occurs. <br>
<p>
Switching register sets take 1 CPU cycle if there is a set available.  If
not it takes significanly longer to store the registers on the stack.
With 8 register sets available, 3% of SAVE/RETURN commands cause
overflow/underflow.  Each additional set cuts this in half.  A modern
machine probably has 32 sets at its disposal.  If we had 8 sets of
registers (set 7 to set 1, start at set 7) at our disposable we would find 
that the input registers of set 7 are the same ar the output registers of
set 0.  We could not use both at once so when we need set 0 we must store
either set 7 or set 0.  Since set 7 probably won't be used for some time,
it is the one stored. So one can only use n-1 of the N sets available at a
time.
<h4>Instruction</H4>
"Restore~~~%g0,%g0,%g0" Increments CWP so the "mailine" gets all its
registers back as they were.  The 96 or so bytes on the stack are now just
junk.  Note in the epilogue that RESTORE sits in RET's delay slot so the
registers are restored before control is passed back to the calling
program.

<h4> 3. Communication</h4>

The parameters are put in %o0,%o1,%o2,%o3,%o4,%o5 in that order. The
called routine recieves the parameters in its corresponding input
registers. This takes care of 97% of all programs.  If there are more
parameters, they must be put on the stack.  If the function returns a
value it should be put in %i0 in the subroutine, so that it comes back in
%o0 in the calling routine.  Normally, if there are more return parameters
they will be put on the stack.  So in a recursive routine which returns two 
values, they should both or one of them put on the stack.<p>

The parameters often need memory to exist in.  This memory is always put
on the stack.  So there is room for 7 parameters on the stack when we do a
"save" command i.e. the 6 input parameters plus a return parameter.  This
is 7*4=28 of the usual 96 bytes on the "save" command.  So that is 28
bytes for the parameters and 64 bytes for the registers for a total of 92.
The stack must be double word aligned for real numbers so the address must
be 0 mod 8 so we add on 4 bytes of padding.  So once the subroutine has
started, the registers are stored the par.0, "the return parameter, par.
1, par.2, ...,par.6, and 4 bytes of padding in order from low memory to
high memory.  Extra input or output parameters must be stored on stack and
will increase the "96" number in the "save" command.<pa>

Eg. Suppose we want %L1 to contain the address of a piece of memory
containing the value of parameter 1 which the subroutine gets in %i0.  We
would do this as follows.<br>
<pre>
    st   %i0,[%fp+68]  !put the parameter on the stack
    add  %fp,68,%L1    !L1 now contains the address of memory containing
                       !the parameter 1 value
</pre>
 
Eg. If we have 8 parameters to pass to a subroutine the first 6 go in %o0
to %o5.  The next two are passed on the stack as follows:<br>
<pre>
Parameter  Calling Program    Called program
7th        %sp +92            %fp+92
8th        %sp +96            %fp+96
           :
           still need 4 bytes of padding
Note if the called program wants to call a subroutine it uses sp for that
not fp.  This is not the same fp as in 68k but it has the same kind of
use.
Calling: save %sp -104,%sp
         mov  %L7,%o0      !parameter 1
           :     :               :
         mov  %L2,%o5      !parameter 6
         st   %L1,[%sp+92] !parameter 7
         st   %L0,[%sp+96] !parameter 8
	 call Called
		:

Called:  save %sp,-96,%sp
	 ld   [%fp+92],%L1
         ld   [%fp+96].%l2
         :
	 ret
	 restore
</pre>
<h4> Fixed and Variable Local Variables</h4>
The fixed local variables have space allocated for them on the stack by
the program segment that uses them.  For example, if MYSUB uses 3 local 
variables, then we have "MYSUB: save %sp,-104,%sp".  It is 96+12-4 = 104.
We subtract 4 as we do not need padding.   The following is an example of
variable local storage and the calculations needed.
<pre>
               highlevel
Procedure X(n:integer);
Var
  Temp:array[1..n] of integer;

		assembler
X: sll  %o0,2,%g1   !g1=n*4 change entries into bytes
   add  %g1,104,%g1 !g1=104+n*4 add to offset 104 ( 8 input parameters)

! round up to 0 mod 8 if not 0 mod 8 address
   add  %g1,7,%g1   !add 7 to g1

!create mask 0xFFFFFFF8
   add  %g2,1,%g2   !put a 1 in lowest bit
   sll  %g2,31,%g2  !move 1 to highest bit (0's elsewhere)
   sra  %g2,28,%g2  !put a 1 in all bits ecxept 3 lowest bits
   and  %g1,%g2,%g1 !zero out last three bits of address
   neg  %g1	    !offset must be negative
   save %sp,%g1,%sp !not too easy to do
</pre>
 
Remember most of the time you don't need the tricky stuff.
