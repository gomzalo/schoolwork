<!-- Question 1 -->
<li>
Write a 68K Simulator program that will determine whether or not a string
of characters constitutes a <em>palindrome</em>. A palindrome is a phrase
or sentence that reads the same forwards or backwards, i.e. the sequence
of characters is the same in either the forward or backward directions.
When determining whether or not a string of characters is a palindrome we
<em>ignore</em> punctuation, spaces and case. That is, the letters 'a' and 
'A' are considered the same. Note that a string that contains nothing but
punctuation and spaces is a palindrome.
<p>
For example the sentences
<pre>Al lets Della call Ed Stella?
Racecar 11, 9-11 racecar!!</pre>
are palindromes.
<p>
Use the <tt> include</tt>  files 
<a href="A4Q1D1.txt">A4Q1D1.txt</a>,
<a href="A4Q1D2.txt">A4Q1D2.txt</a>,
<a href="A4Q1D3.txt">A4Q1D3.txt</a>,
<a href="A4Q1D4.txt">A4Q1D4.txt</a>,
<a href="A4Q1D5.txt">A4Q1D5txt</a>,
<a href="A4Q1D6.txt">A4Q1D6.txt</a>,
 which define a string named <tt>instr</tt>.
Note that there is a null byte at both the beginning and the end
of the string. You may find this useful in your algorithm.
</p>
<p>
Echo the input string using <tt>strout</tt>. Enclose the string in
quotation marks when you echo it. The <tt>charout</tt> function is 
useful for this purpose. Print a message on the same line as the input
string that indicates whether or not the string is a palindrome.
</p>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<li>
<p>
Write a SPARC Assembly Language program that will implement signed
multiplication using the shift and add algorithm and signed division
using the shift and subtract algorithm. The multiplication algorithm
will accept two signed 16-bit integers and produce the signed 32-bit
product. The division algorithm will a signed 32-bit dividend and a
signed 16-bit divisor and produce a 32-bit quotient.
</p>
<p>
Your program will have a main loop which will accept a single letter
task as input from the keyboard. The task will one of M, D or Q representing
Multiply, Divide or Quit. You can assume that the input for the task will
consist of only these three letters. The main processing loop will keep
accepting tasks until Quit is specified.
</p>
<p>
When Multiply or Divide is specified, the program should accept two signed
integers from the keyboard, then perform the specified operation and print
the answer. You can assume that all number input will fit into the sizes
specified above. For the Divide operation, your program should check for
division by zero and print an appropriate error message.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to echo all input and print the answer in an appropriate format. For
example, your output may look like this:
<pre>
Enter a task: M
Enter the first value: 12
Enter the second value: -2
12 x -2 = -24</pre>
</p>
<p>
Use the input contained in <a href="A4Q2.txt">A4Q2.txt</a>.
