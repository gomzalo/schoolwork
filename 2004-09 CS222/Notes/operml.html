<h3><align=center> Basic Operation of Machine Language</h3>
Read 3.1(P59-61), 3.3,3.5 4.1-4.4 in Ford & Topp
<p> The control unit executes instructions from top to bottom.  For each
instruction it does the following:
<ol>
<li> FETCH instruction
<ul>
<li> get ML instruction FROM MEMORY
<li> decode that instruction
</ul>
<li> EXECUTE instruction
<ul>
<li> often read data FROM MEMOERY (sometimes data is part of instruction)
<li> perform operation (+, -  etc.)
<li> often store data TO MEMORY
</ul></ol>

<p> FETCH is the big time hog.  Getting data from instruction is
considered part of the FETCH and is especially slow.  Storing data is also
slow.  A/L operations are quick.
<br> The getting and storing of data is referred to as the "Von Neumann
Bottleneck". 


<h3><align=center> HARDWARE MODEL </h3>
<h4>Memory</h4>
<ul>
<li> Addresses are 24 bits in 68000, 32 bits (680x0).
<LI> Each BYTE=8 bits has its own address.
<LI> Word = 16 bits, Longword (LONG) =32 bits in 68k
<LI> Bit 0 is least significant (rightmost) bit. Bit 7/15/31 is most
signifcant for various sizes
<LI> The 2/4/8 bytes of a thing are stored in consecutive memory
locations.<BR>
Eg. ABCD1234 in address 500<BR>
<table>
<tr><td>BIG Endian <td>Little Endian</tr>
<tr><td>500 501 502 503 <td> 500 501 502 503</tr>
<tr><td> AB  CD  12  34 <td>  34 12 CD AB</tr>
<tr><TD>68K  <td> 80x86</tr>
<tr><td>SPARC <td>DEC ALPHA</tr>
<TR><TD>IBM/370 <td> DEC VAX</tr>
<tr><td>RS/6000</tr>
<tr><td>natural order?  <td>00000005 stored at addr x in 4 bytes is<BR>
                     0005 stored at addr x in 2 bytes is<BR>
                     05 stored at addr x in 1 byte.<tr></UL>
</table>
<H4> NOTATION</H4>
<table>
<tr><td>LSB of<td>&nbsp;<td> 34 </tr>
<tr><td>MSB of<td> ABCD1234  is <td>   AB</tr>
<tr><td>LSW of<td>&nbsp;<td> 1234</tr>
<tr><td>MSW of<td>&nbsp;<td> ABCD</tr>
</table>

<H4> Boundary Alignment </H4>
Physical data path sizes between CPU and memory vary (8,16,32,64 are
common)  Consider a 16 bit data path.  Memory can fetch only WORDs.<br>
WORD at 0000, at 0002, at 0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no problem.<BR>
<BR>
If CPU needs BYTE at 0002 or 0003, the control unit can ignore lowest bits
of word at 0002.  OK<BR>
If CPU needs LONG word at 0002, it does 2 consecutive fetches.  OK<BR>
If CPU needs WORD at 0003, then it fetches WORDs at 0002 and 0004 take
them apart and reassemble them.  BAD!  It is slow or impossible.<BR><BR>

<b>SO</B> a block of N bytes should be stored at a multiple of N.<BR><BR>
68000- WORD/LONGWORD <B> must </b> be stored at even addresses.



<h3>Assembly Process</h3>
Pass I
Assembler loads program at some specified address .  It sets PC or
programmer counter, a register to this address and then sequentially runs
through the program figuring out how long each instruction is and adding
that to program counter.  When a symbolic name is reached it stores name
and address(i.e. PC value) in symbol table.  If an include file statement
is reached(68k) or an outside function is referenced(SPARC), the linker is
called to load in the file's content starting at
this location.  Then pass 1 continues. 
<p>Pass II 
Starting at the specified address, the control unit runs through the
program translating assembly instructions to machine instructions in a
1-1 fashion.  Symbolic names are replaced by addreesses by looking them
up in symbol table.
<p>
Run Time Environment<br>
Today it is multi-users, multi-threaded,which means programs must be
relocatable in memory as they will be swapped in and out of memory even in
personal one-user lap-top machines.
