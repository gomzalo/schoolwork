<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SPARC Delayed Branching</H2>

<P>If a branch or CALL is done on a SPARC, the new address is loaded into
the <B>nPC, not the PC</B>.</P>

<P>Effect: <B>The instruction following the branch is executed before the
branch takes effect.</B></P>

<P>The position immediately following any branch or call instruction is
called the &quot;delay slot&quot;, and the instruction in that position
is the &quot;delay instruction&quot;.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Addr  Code
----  ----------------------
1000  addcc %g0,%g0,%g0
1004  be    where
1008  subcc %g0,123,%L1
100C  st    %L1,[%i0+%i1]
...
2000  where: add %L1,%G0,%L2
2004         ld [%i0+%i1],%L3</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Effect:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE> PC   nPC  What's happening
---- ----  -----------------------
1000 1004  addcc executing, be    being fetched
1004 1008  be    executing, subcc being fetched
1008 2000  subcc executing, add   being fetched
2000 2004  add   executing, ld    being fetched</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>***ALWAYS FILL THE DELAY SLOT!!***</B></P>

<P>What can be put into the delay slot?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Some useful instruction that should be executed whether you branch
  or not.
  <LI>Some instruction that does useful work only when you branch (or when
  you don't branch), but doesn't do any harm if executed in the other case.
  <LI>When all else fails, a NOP instruction.
</UL>

<P>What <B>MUST NOT</B> be put into the delay slot?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Anything that sets the CC that the branch decision depends on. The
  branch instruction makes the <B>decision</B> on whether to branch or not
  right away but it doesn't actually <B>do</B> the branch until after the
  delay instruction. (Only the branch is delayed, not the decision.)
  <LI>Another branch instruction. (What happens if you do this is not even
  defined! The result is unpredictable!)
  <LI>A &quot;set&quot; instruction. This is really two instructions, not
  one, and only half of it will be in the delay slot. (The assembler will
  warn you about this.)
</UL>

<P>Example 1:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Loop: ...
      ...
      add %L1,%L2,%L1 !Add %L2 to the sum in %L1
      add %L3,1,%L3   !Increment the counter
      ba  Loop        !Back to the Loop again
      nop             !The delay slot</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>should not be done that way. Instead, use:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Loop: ...
      ...
      add %L1,%L2,%L1 !Add %L2 to the sum in %L1
      ba  Loop        !Back to the Loop again
      add %L3,1,%L3   !Increment the counter (delay slot)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Example 2:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Loop: add   %L3,1,%L3   !Increment the counter
      ...
      subcc %L2,%L3,%G0 !Compare %L2 to %L3
      bne   Loop        !Loop until they are equal
      nop               !The delay slot</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>should not be done that way. Instead, use:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>      add   %L3,1,%L3   !Increment the counter
Loop: ...
      subcc %L2,%L3,%G0 !Compare %L2 to %L3
      bne   Loop        !Loop until they are equal
      add   %L3,1,%L3   !Increment the counter</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This one is better, because the number of instructions inside the loop
has been decreased by 1. However, this version increments %L3 once too often.
If the value of %L3 is not important after the loop is finished, then that
it not a problem. If the value of %L3 is important, then you could add the
instruction</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>      sub   %L3,1,%L3 !Undo the last addition.</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This looks like a poor solution, but it is better to do an extra instruction
once after the end of a loop than an extra instruction every time through
the loop.</P>

<P>(There is also another solution to this problem - the &quot;bne,a&quot;
instruction - but we will not cover it in this course.)</P>

<P>Example 3: This program contains a bug:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Loop: set   Array,%L4   !Put Array's address in %L4
      ...
      subcc %L2,%L3,%G0 !Compare %L2 to %L3
      bne   Loop        !Loop until they are equal

! -------------------
! Another line has been finished.
! Increment the line counter in %G1
!--------------------

      add   %G1,1,%G1
      ...</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The correct code is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>Loop: set   Array,%L4   !Put Array's address in %L4
      ...
      subcc %L2,%L3,%G0 !Compare %L2 to %L3
      bne   Loop        !Loop until they are equal
      nop

! -------------------
! Another line has been finished.
! Increment the line counter in %G1
!--------------------

      add   %G1,1,%G1
      ...</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Without the &quot;nop&quot; in the delay slot, the &quot;add&quot; will
be done every time through the loop (the add will be in the delay slot).
Since we can't put the &quot;subcc&quot; in the delay slot (the branch depends
on it), and we can't put the &quot;set&quot; in the delay slot either, we'll
have to settle for a &quot;nop&quot;.</P>
