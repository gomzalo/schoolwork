<H3>Move Instructions</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>Move</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>move{.size} src,dst</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>The destination (dst) operand must be a &quot;data alterable mode&quot;
    (it cannot be an A register, an immediate operand (#const), or a PC-relative
    address).
    <LI>"size" can be b or w or l i.e. byte, word, longword
    <li>Action - copies the value in source to the destination
  </UL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>move.b D2,D3<BR>
    move.w (A2)+,45(A1)<BR>
    move.l #23456,-(SP)</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>Movea (move into A register)</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>movea{.w or .l} src,Ai</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>In machine language, this is identical to &quot;move&quot;. There is
    really no restriction that says &quot;dst&quot; can't be an A register.
    Simulator doesn't care if you use &quot;movea&quot; or &quot;move&quot;, 
    but other assemblers might.
    <LI>If no size is specified, &quot;.w&quot; is assumed. That will usually
    be a <B>disaster</B>. <B>ALWAYS PUT THE &quot;.L&quot; ON IT!</B>
  </UL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>movea.l A4,A3 ;Ptr1:=Ptr2<BR>
    movea.l 4(A2),A2 ;Ptr:=Ptr^.Link</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>Moveq (move quick)</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>moveq #small,Di</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>Very restricted: The source operand must use immediate mode, and only
    with an 8-bit signed integer constant (-128..127). The destination must
    be a D register.
    <LI>The constant is sign-extended and fills the entire D register
    <LI>No size is allowed (not moveq.w or moveq.b).
    <LI>So why not just use &quot;move #7,D3&quot; instead of &quot;moveq #7,D3&quot;?
    <UL>
      <LI>When you can use it, moveq is faster.
      <LI>The machine language instruction is 2 bytes, not 6 bytes.
    </UL>
  </UL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>moveq #5,D3</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Add/Subtract Instructions</H3>

<P>The subtraction instructions are identical to the add instructions. Just
change &quot;add&quot; to &quot;sub&quot; in all of the instructions below.
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that the subtraction operation is 
dst - src --&gt; dst
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>Add</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>add{.size} src,dst</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>The destination (dst) operand must be a &quot;data alterable mode&quot;
    (it cannot be an A register, an immediate operand (#const), or a PC-relative
    address).
    <LI><B>One of the two operands must be a D register</B>
    <LI>If this is a problem, use one of the specialized instructions that
    follow.
  </UL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>add.b D2,D3<BR>
    add.w (A2)+,D4<BR>
    add.l D4,16(A3)</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>Adda (Add to A register)</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>adda{.w or .l} src,Ai</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>This time &quot;adda&quot; and &quot;add&quot; are really different,
    even in machine language, and you must use the right one.
    <LI>If no size is specified, &quot;.w&quot; is assumed. That will usually
    be a <B>disaster</B>. <B>ALWAYS PUT THE &quot;.L&quot; ON IT!</B>
  </UL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>adda.l #16,A4 ;Advance a pointer by 16 bytes<BR>
    adda.l D4,A3 ;Add a calculated amount to A3<BR>
    adda.l 46(A2),A3 ;Unlikely, but legal</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>Addi (Add immediate)</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>addi{.size} #const,dst</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>The destination (dst) operand must be a &quot;data alterable mode&quot;
    (it cannot be an A register, an immediate operand (#const), or a PC-relative
    address).
  </UL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>addi.l #16,(A4) ;add or adda can't do this<BR>
    addi.w #1,Count ;Count:=Count+1</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>Addq (add quick)</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>addq{.size} #verysmall,dst</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>The source operand must use immediate mode, and only with a small 
     positive constant between 1 and 8 inclusive.
    <LI>The destination (dst) operand cannot be an immediate operand (#const), 
     or a PC-relative address) (but an A register is OK).
    <LI>A size is allowed (unlike moveq).
    <LI>So why not just use &quot;add #7,D3&quot; instead of &quot;addq #7,D3&quot;?
    <UL>
      <LI>When you can use it, addq is much faster.
      <LI>The machine language instruction is only 2 bytes (the opcode only).
    </UL>
  </UL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>addq.w #1,D3 ;Fastest way to increment D3<BR>
    addq.l #8,A3 ;Can even add to an A register<BR>
    addq.b #1,Code ;or memory</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>LEA (Load Effective Address)</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>lea source ,Ai</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The first operand must refer directly to an address in memory. It cannot be Di, Ai, (Ai)+, -(Ai), or #const. But no memory access is done. Instead, the address that would have been used by a normal instruction (move, add, etc.) is placed in Ai.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>lea Junk,A3 ;Put the address Junk into A3 (right)<BR>
  movea.l #Junk,A3 ;Put the address Junk into A3 (wrong)</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Under &quot;normal&quot; conditions, the above two instructions would
accomplish the same thing. However, due to &quot;relocatability&quot; in
real-life systems (Mac + MAS), the second one will generate an error message.
Always use the first one.</P>

<H3>CLR (Clear)</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>clr{.size} dst</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Clears the destination to 0. The destination (dst) operand must be a
&quot;data alterable mode&quot; (it cannot be an A register, an immediate
operand (#const), or a PC-relative address).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>clr.w D3 ;Initialize D3 to 0<BR>
  clr.l Count ;Initialize Count to 0<BR>
  clr.w (A4)+ ;Clear the next word in the array</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>NEG (Negate)</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>neg{.size} dst</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Negates the destination (twos complements it). The destination (dst)
operand must be a &quot;data alterable mode&quot; (it cannot be an A register,
an immediate operand (#const), or a PC-relative address).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>neg.w D3 ;Negate D3<BR>
  neg.l X ;Negate X<BR>
  neg.w (A4)+ ;Negate the next word in the array</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>JSR (Jump to SubRoutine)</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>jsr addresss</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is not a complete description of this instruction. That will be
done later. For now, we will only use it to call built-in library routines
(for things such as I/O).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>jsr stop ;terminate this program<BR>
  jsr decin ;read in a decimal number<BR>
  jsr strout ;write out a character string</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Compare Instructions</H3>

<P>The compare instructions are almost identical to the subtract instructions
(which are the same as the add instructions above). Just change &quot;add&quot;
to &quot;cmp&quot; in all of the instructions above, with the following
exceptions:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>In the &quot;cmp&quot; instruction, it is always the <B>second</B>
  operand which must be Di.
  <LI>There is no &quot;cmpq&quot; instruction.
</UL>

<P>Compare instructions are the same as subtract instructions in their
operation, except that the result of the calculation is discarded. The
only purpose is to set the condition code.  Following a compare
instruction, you almost always find a conditional branch. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>cmp.w D2,D3 ;perform D3-D2, set CC reg, discard result<BR>
  cmpi.b #'0',D4 ;compare D4 to the ascii code for '0'<BR>
  cmpa.l A2,A3 ;compare two pointers in A2 and A3 (A3-A2)<BR>
  cmp.w D3,#10 ;WRONG!!<BR>
  cmp.w #10,D3 ;RIGHT!!</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<h3> Branch Instructions </h3>
After a compare instruction, move or arithmetic, you often find a
conditional branch statement which may cause the next statement to be
executed to be changed to the address on the branch statement.  This is
done by putting the address into the PC.  The branch is controlled by 5
flags in the Condition Code Register.  A flag is a 1 bit piece of storage
that control various branch instructions.  The flags are:
<pre>
Z-it is set(i.e. made 1) if the result is 0, otherwise it is cleared
(made 0)
N-it is set if result is negative, otherwise it is cleared
V-it is set if there is an overflow i.e. the number is too large to be
stored and is cleared otherwise
C-it is set if there is a borrow or carry out of the top bit (overflow
for unsigned integers) otherwise it is cleared.  
More on these flags later.

Unconditional Branch
BRA    PLACE
works like a "go to".  The instruction at PLACE will be the next one to be
executed.

Conditional Branches
BEQ    PLace    If result is 0, then execute instruction at PLACE
                otherwise  execute next instruction.
BNE    PLACE    If result is not 0, then ... instruction
BLT    PLACE    If result &lt;  0, then ... instruction
BLE    PLACE    If result &lt;= 0, then ... instruction
BGT    PLACE    If result &gt;  0, then ... instruction
BGE    PLACE    If result &gt;= 0, then ... instruction
</pre>

<h3>Multiplication</h3>
<pre>
MULU   source,Dn   Unsigned Multiplication
MULS   source,Dn   Signed Multiplication  

Action - multiplies two 16 bit operands, yielding a 32 bit
operand stored in Dn.  No carry or overflow is possible
</pre>

<h3>Division</h3>
<pre>
DIVU   source,Dn    Unsigned Division
DIVS   source,Dn    Signed Division

Action - Divide the 32 bit destination operand (right side) by the 16 bit
source operand and store the quotient in LSW of the destination and the
remainder in the MSW of the destination.
</pre>
<b>Notes</b>
<ol>
<li>Division by 0 generates an exception and usually stops the program
with an error.
<li>Overflow is possible and detected.  No operation occurs. When does
this happen and does the simulator do this really?
<li>In signed division the sign of the remainder is always the same as the
sign of the dividend unless the remainder is 0.
</ol>
<h3>Swap Instruction</h3>
Swap   Dn  causes the contents of MSW and LSW of Dn to be interchanged.

<p><p><h3>Test Intruction</h3>
TST.{size} <ea>  checks the value in <ea> and sets the Z and N flags.
