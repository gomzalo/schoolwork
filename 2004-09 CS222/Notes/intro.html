<h2>
Introduction to Assembly Language</h2></center>

<h4>
Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Control Unit is device which "runs" the CPU.</li>

<li>
ALU-arithmetic/logic unit does the arithmetic and logic.</li>

<li>
Main Memory stores everything.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Main Memory</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Conceptually like a very long strip of memory locations.  </li>

<li>
Each location holds a 0 or a 1 called a <b>bit </b>= <b>bi</b>nary
digi<b>t.</b></li>

<li>
8 bits = 1 byte, 2 bytes = 1 word, 2 words = 1 double word</li>

<li>
Each byte (or word) has an address and can be accessed directly, i.e. RAM
- random access memory.</li>

<li>
Everthing, i.e. instructions, data, software must be stored in main memory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<font size=+0>Machine Language:</font></h2>

<ul>
<li>
The only language that is ever actually executed by a computer.</li>

<li>
Composed of instructions encoded as strings of 0's and 1's.</li>

<li>
Never written and rarely read directly by programmers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Assembler Language:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Programmers write in <b>Assembly Language.&nbsp; </b>It uses mnemonics,
eg.&nbsp; instead of 110001011 there is ADD</li>

<li>
1-1: One assembly language instruction corresponds to one machine language
instruction.</li>

<li>
(Exception: "synthetic instructions" or "pseudo instructions" may translate
into a more than one machine language instruction.&nbsp; Also special 
input/output instructions save much programming time.)</li>

<li>
The <b>Assembler</b> (a program) translates assembly code into machine
code.</li>

<li>
Assembler language is just a more readable version of machine language
(machine language in symbolic form instead of binary form).</li>

<li>
You write Assembly code; Assembler translates it into machine code; Control
unit runs machine code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
High-Level Languages (Pascal, C, Java, Prologue etc.):</h4>

<dir>
<li>
Assembly language is still tedious to work in so most work done in HLL.</li>

<li>
Translated into machine language by a <b>Compiler</b> (sometimes an intermediate
language).</li>

<li>
One-to-many: One HLL statement tranlates into several or several dozen
of machine instructions.</li>

<li>
Much more abstract and compact.</li>

<li>
Compilers translate everything at once and only once.&nbsp;
<b>Interpreters</b>
translate one statement at a time and every time a statement is encountered,
eg. a loop, it must be translated from scratch each time through the 
loop.</li>
</dir>


<h4>
Why USE Assembly language?</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Old&nbsp; reason: To get very efficient code in time-critical places. No
longer true. Compilers generate better code than almost all assembly
language programmers.</li>

<li>
Valid Reason: Need access to specific hardware features or instructions,
eg. set interrupt level in state register - cannot be done in any HLL.&nbsp;
This occurs in system programming and is implemented via assembly language
subprograms.&nbsp; Also programmers contolling physical objects eg. robots,
programm in assembly language.  Also needed for embedded programming.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
OK, then, Why STUDY Assembly Language?</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Needed for a full understanding of HLLs and the reason for some of their
unusual rules.</li>

<li>
Needed in order to write many programs <b>well</b> (to understand efficiency
issues) especially in parallel computers.</li>

<li>
Needed to write or understand compilers, interpreters, debuggers.</li>

<li>
The basis for understanding computer hardware and computer organization
(74.337).</li>

<li>
The chance to develope and implement algorithms
</li>

<li>
To be a "Computer Scientist": This is the way ALL software runs and what
ALL hardware has as its core function.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
We will study</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Motorola 68000 and Sparc to compare and contrast major paradyms in assemblers.
</li>

<li>
We will not study MAS directly as there are no more MACs around. Instead
we will use a 68000 simulater.&nbsp; Like all simulators, this one is
slightly different from MAS.  We will learn the BSVC simulator and if you
can logon to the university system from home, you can run it from home.   
</li>

<li>
The SPARC assembly language we will get from CCU.&nbsp; The CC compiler
understands it as well as C.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Data</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Strings of 0's and 1's.</li>

<li>
Many different ways to represent integers, real numbers and characters.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Reading</h4>
In Ford &amp; Topp 1-23,59-72.&nbsp; But you must know number systems and
specfically how to change from one number sytem to another one.&nbsp; Eg.&nbsp;
You must know algorithms to change 136<sub>7</sub>=6A<sub>12</sub>.
<br><sub>&nbsp;</sub>
