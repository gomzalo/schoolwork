Stay away from speghetti code!

<h2> IF </h2>

<H4> Simple IF</h4>
<pre>
a)HLL               b) SPARC

x:=x+1              ADD      1,%L0  !L0 holds x
IF A=7 THEN         CMP      7,%L1  !L1 holds A
                    BNE      NEXT
                    NOP
   B:=3;            MOV      3,%L2    !L2 holds B
END IF         NEXT:    
x:=x+2;             ADD      %L0,2,%L0

b) At HLL

IF X=2 THEN                   CODE:=2;
   CODE:=1;       change to   IF X=2 THEN
ELSE                             CODE:=1;
   CODE:=2;                   END IF
END IF

This simplifies the code.

c) GENERAL IF

HLL                        SPARC

IF (I > 0) THEN            CMP      0,%L0    %L0 holds I
   A:=1                    BLE      ELSE
                           NOP
ELSE                       MOV      1,%L1    %L1 holds A    
   B:=2                    BA      NEXT
                           NOP
END IF                ELSE:
                           MOV      2,%L2    %L2 holds B
NEXT                  NEXT:


d) I never want to see:

      STUFF                           STUFF
      BA NEXT    replace with    NEXT:
      NOP
NEXT:

You want to reduce the number of branches not put in superflous ones
because branches are slow.

<h2 align=center> Loops</h2>

There are two types of loops in the world - REPEAT loops and WHILE loops.
Repeat Loops are always executed once which is a rare for loops.  You must
always check yourself to see if it is safe to use a repeat loop.  A while
loop can be executed zero times and is always safe and very common in
programming.


<h4> REPEAT Loops</h4>

a) Standard Repeat Loop
<PRE>
REPEAT:                        A read with a sentinel is 
     CALL     DECIN             suitable for a repeat loop.
     NOP
     CMP      -1,%o0
     BEQ      NEXT
     NOP
     :                ! body of loop
     BA       REPEAT
     NOP
NEXT:

b) General Loop  (Realy a Repeat loop)

Loop:
      :              ! body of loop before test 
     CMP      0,%L3         
     BLT      NEXT
     NOP
      :              ! body of loop after test
     BA       LOOP
     NOP
NEXT:

<h4>  While Loop </h4>

a) OK VERSION            b) Better Version

        :                     :
        :                     :
                              BRA CHECK
LOOP:                         NOP
    CMP     0,%L3          LOOP:
    BEQ     ENDLOOP            :        !body of loop
    NOP
    : !body of loop        CHECK:
    BA     LOOP                CMP   0,%L3
    NOP                        BNE   LOOP 
                               NOP
ENDLOOP:                      
    NEXT CODE                  NEXT CODE

<H4>Some General Points about Loops</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Most loops are &quot;top-tested&quot; (like WHILE loops in Pascal or
  C). This is correct most of the time.
  <LI>The loop condition should be tested before executing the body of the
  loop for the first time, not after. This allows the body of the loop to
  be executed 0 times, if that is appropriate.  In some instances the
  repeat-until loop is the loop of choice. 
  <LI>In assembler language, a conditional branch will test the loop condition.
  <LI>This does not mean that the conditional branch should appear at the
  start of the loop in assembler language, though. Usually, it should be
  placed at the bottom, and there should be an unconditional branch to the
  bottom of the loop to get it started.  Occassionally, if the loop is
  very long, this procedure is not followed.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>What's the difference?
  <UL>
    <LI>In the first one, there are two branches inside the loop.
    <LI>In the second one, there is only one branch inside the loop. The other
    one is outside the loop where it is only done once, not every iteration.
    <LI>Particularly in today's pipelined processors, it is very important
    to minimize the number of branches, and simplify loop structures.
