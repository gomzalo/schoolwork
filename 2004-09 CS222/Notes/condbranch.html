<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Conditional Branches</H2>

<UL>
  <LI>Most CPUs contain a CC (Condition Code) register. Actually, it is a
  section of the SR or PSR register.
  <LI>The CC usually contains 4 bits: N Z V C
  <LI>The 680x0 also has an X bit, which we will not cover.
  <LI>The CC is set following every move or arithmetic instruction on the
  680x0.
  <LI>Setting the condition code is optional on the SPARC. Add &quot;cc&quot;
  to the end of any arithmetic or logical opcode to set the condition code.
  (Use &quot;addcc&quot; instead of &quot;add&quot;, for example.) Don't
  forget to do it when you need it!
  <LI>The Z bit is set to 1 if the result was Zero. (It is set if all bits
  of the result were 0's.)
  <LI>The N bit is set to 1 if the result was Negative. (In other words,
  it is set to the sign bit of the result.)
  <LI>The V bit is set to 1 if the operation caused an oVerflow (For add/sub,
  <B>signed</B> values are assumed). An overflow occurs when there is no
  encoding/representation for the correct answer in the space available.
  <LI>The C bit is set to 1 if the operation caused a carry (or borrow) out
  of the top bit. This is an overflow bit for <B>unsigned</B> values when
  using add/sub. (It has some other uses which may be covered later.)
</UL>

<P>Detection of overflow when adding or subtracting:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The rule for addition is: There was an overflow if and only if the
  sign bit of the result is different from the signs of <B>both</B> operands.
  (Since adding two positive numbers cannot possibly give a negative result,
  and vice-versa, this makes sense.)
  <LI>Another trick that works: There is an overflow if and only if the carry
  coming <B>in</B> to the sign bit column is different from the carry coming
  <B>out</B> of the sign bit column (the C bit).
  <LI>For subtraction, use the same rules, but invert the sign of the second
  number.
</UL>

<P>For example, assuming the 8-bit addition Sum&lt;-A+B, here is how the
CC would be set:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE> A  B   Sum   N Z V C
 -- -- -----  - - - -
 1F FF (1)1E  0 0 0 1
 01 FF (1)00  0 1 0 1
 40 40 (0)80  1 0 1 0
 A0 A0 (1)40  0 0 1 1
 00 01 (0)01  0 0 0 0</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>Subtraction is done by twos complementing the second number, then adding.
  The CC is set as usual by this addition, except that the C bit is set to
  the opposite value when subtracting any number other than 0 (it becomes
  a &quot;borrow bit&quot; and not a &quot;carry bit&quot;). It still indicates
  an &quot;unsigned overflow&quot;.
  <LI>For example, assuming the 8-bit subtraction Diff&lt;-A&shy;B, here
  is how the CC would be set:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE> A  B  -B  Diff  N Z V C
 -- -- -- -----  - - - -
 1F FF 01 (0)20  0 0 0 1
 01 FF 01 (0)02  0 0 0 1
 FF 01 FF (1)FE  1 0 0 0
 22 00 00 (0)22  0 0 0 0
 40 40 C0 (1)00  0 1 0 0
 A0 60 A0 (1)40  0 0 1 0
 40 C0 40 (0)80  1 0 1 1</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>Compare instructions exist on most machines, and their sole purpose
  is to set the CC. They behave exactly the same as a subtraction, except
  that the result is discarded.
  <LI>For 68000, use &quot;cmp&quot; (same rules as for add/sub).
  <LI>For SPARC, use a &quot;subcc&quot; with %g0 for the result. There is
  no separate compare instruction. (RISC)
  <LI>Following a comparison, there is usually a conditional branch instruction
  which will branch to some address (label) if the CC bits satisfy a certain
  condition. The syntax for both SPARC and 680x0 is:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE> b<FONT SIZE=-2>cc</FONT> Label (replace &quot;b<FONT SIZE=-2>cc</FONT>&quot; by one of the opcodes below)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>There are four types of conditional branches:
  <UL>
    <LI>Those that check one particular bit in the CC
    <LI>Those that are used following comparisons of <B>signed</B> integers
    <LI>Those that are used following comparisons of <B>unsigned</B> integers
  </UL>
  <LI>There are also the unconditional branches - branch always and branch
  never
