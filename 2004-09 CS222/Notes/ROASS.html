<p><b>Course Topics</b> </p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principles behind machine languages and assembly
  language programming. Techniques for data structures, subprograms, parameters,
  recursion.  A comparison of the two machines 68000 and SPARC.     
<p></p>
     
<p><b> Midterm</b> </p>
	The midterm will be at night at the same time for both
sections.  Stay tuned for time and place.

<p><b>Final Exam</b> </p>
     
<p>The final exam will be three hours long. </p>
       The class lectures, assignments, and labs make up the course content.
  Everything in the course content is potentially examinable.        
<p><b>Class Attendance</b> </p>
     
<p>You are expected to attend classes; important announcements may be made
    only in class. </p>
     
<p><b>Assignments and Labs</b> </p>
      
<p>Expect five assignments and six labs. Assignments are due in class on the
due  date. Late assignments will not be accepted.<br>
    </p>
    
<p>If you obtain <b>less than 40% </b>of the total possible marks on the
assignment
portion of the course,  you fail the course.  If you attend <b>fewer than
5 </b> labs, you grade will be lowered one level for each missing lab.    </p>
       
<p>You will receive grades on some assignments prior to the voluntary withdrawal
    date. Generally, the professor will be happy to review marks on assignments,
    but any such requests should be made within two weeks of the handing
back     date. </p>
       
<p><b>Academic Honesty</b> </p>
       
<p>Academic dishonesty is a very serious offence and will be dealt with in 
   accordance with the University's discipline bylaw. Examples of academic 
 dishonesty  include: submitting assignments which are not <b>entirely</b> 
your own work, faking output that was not produced by your program, use
of unauthorized material during a test or examination, 
 writing an examination  for another person or having another person write 
 an examination for you.  Do not post solutions to assignments or give your 
 solutions to other students.  Such actions may become plagiarism if those 
 solutions are required in subsequent  assignment questions. </p>
       
<p>A declaration sheet, which states that the work being submitted is completely
    your own, is available at <a
 href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/newsite/honesty.html"
>http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/newsite/honesty.html</a>.
    This sheet must be printed out, filled in, signed, and attached to <b>every</b>
assignment which is submitted. Any occurrence of plagiarism will be handled
    by the Associate Head of the Department of Computer Science. </p>
