<H2>SPARC Instruction Types</H2>

<P>There are very few addressing modes on the SPARC, and they may be used
only in certain very restricted combinations. The three main types of SPARC
instructions are given below, along with the valid combinations of addressing
modes. There are only a few unusual instructions which do not fall into
these catagories.</P>

<H4>1. Arithmetic/Logical/Shift instructions</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>opcode reg1,reg2,reg3    !reg1 op reg2    -&gt; reg3</TT>
<TT>opcode reg1,const13,reg3 !reg1 op const13 -&gt; reg3</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>All &quot;action&quot; instructions (add, sub, and, or, etc.) take
  three operands.
  <LI>The destination is always the third operand.
  <LI>The middle operand may be a 13-bit signed constant (-4096...+4095).
  <LI>Otherwise, all operands are registers.
  <LI>Examples:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>add %L1,%L2,%L3 !%L1+%L2-&gt;%L3</TT>
<TT>add %L1,1,%L1   !increment L1</TT>
<TT>sub %g0,%i3,%i3 !negate i3</TT>
<TT>sub %L1,10,%G0  !compare %L1 to 10 (discard result)</TT>
<TT>add %L1,%G0,%L2 !move %L1 to %L2 (add 0 to it)</TT>
<TT>add %G0,%G0,%L4 !clear L4 (0+0 -&gt;%L4)</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>To do the above things in the 680x0, 6 different opcodes would be needed
  (move, add, addi, clr, neg, cmp)
</UL>

<H4>2. Load/Store Instructions</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>opcode [reg1+reg2],reg3<BR>
  opcode [reg1+const13],reg3</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Only</B> load and store instructions can access memory.
  <LI>The contents of reg3 is read/written from/to the address in memory
  formed by adding reg1+reg2, or else reg1+const13 (a 13- bit signed constant
  as above).
  <LI>The operands are written in the reverse direction for store instructions,
  so that the destination is always last.
  <LI>One of reg1 or const13 can be omitted. The assembler will supply $g0
  or 0. (This is a shorthand provided by the assembler. Both are always there
  in machine language.)
  <LI>Examples:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>ld [%L1+%L2],%L3 !word at address [%L1+%L2]-&gt;%L3</TT>
<TT>ld [%L1+8],%L2   !word at address [%L1+8]-&gt;%L2</TT>
<TT>ld [%L1],%L2     !word at address [%L1]-&gt;%L2</TT>
<TT>st %g0,[%i2+0]   !0 -&gt; word at address in %i2</TT>
<TT>st %g0,[%i2]     !same as above</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>3. Branch Instructions</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>opcode address</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>Branch to (or otherwise use) the address given.
  <LI>There are actually 2 types of addresses (see &quot;relocatability&quot;
  later) - but they look the same.
  <LI>Examples:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>call printf</TT>
<TT>be   Loop</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>That's it. Period. No other modes or combinations of modes are possible.
This is a RISC machine and R stands for &quot;Reduced&quot;.</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>add %L1,[%L2],%L3 !Invalid. No memory access allowed.</TT>
<TT>ld  5,%L4         !Invalid. Must be a memory access.</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>SPARC Fundamental Instructions</H2>

<H3>Load/Store Instructions</H3>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Only these instructions access memory.</B>
  <LI>All 32 bits of the register are always affected by a load. If a shorter
  data item is loaded, it is padded by either adding zeroes (for unsigned
  data), or by sign extension (for signed data).
  <LI>In effect, data in memory may be 1, 2, or 4 bytes long, but data in
  registers is always 4 bytes long.
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>ld   - load (load a word into a register)</TT>
<TT>st   - store (store a word into memory)</TT>
<TT>ldub - load unsigned byte (fetch a byte, pad with 0's)</TT>
<TT>ldsb - load signed byte (fetch a byte, sign extend it)</TT>
<TT>lduh - load unsigned halfword (fetch 2 bytes, pad)</TT>
<TT>ldsh - load signed halfword (fetch 2 bytes, sign extend)</TT>
<TT>stb  - store byte (store only the LSB)</TT>
<TT>sth  - store halfword (store only the 2 LSB's)</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<MENU>
  <LI>There are also two instructions for double words. The register number
  must be even, and 8 bytes are loaded or stored. The MSW goes to the even
  register and the LSW to the odd register that follows it.
</MENU>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>ldd - load double (load 2 words into 2 registers)<BR>
  std - store double (store 2 words from 2 registers)</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Arithmetic/Logical Instructions</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>All 32 bits of every register is used.
  <LI>Setting the condition code is always optional. Add &quot;cc&quot; to
  the opcode to set the condition code. By default, it is <B>not</B> set.
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>add  - a+b</TT>
<TT>sub  - a-b</TT>
<TT>and  - a&amp;b (bitwise AND)</TT>
<TT>andn - a&amp;~b (bitwise and - second operand complemented)</TT>
<TT>or   - a|b (bitwise OR)</TT>
<TT>orn  - a|~b (bitwise or - second operand complemented)</TT>
<TT>xor  - a^b (bitwise exclusive or)</TT>
<TT>xnor - a^~b (bitwise exor - second operand complemented)</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<MENU>
  <LI>Examples:
</MENU>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>add   %L1,%L2,%L3  ;add %L1+%L2 -&gt; %L3</TT>
<TT>subcc %L4,10,%G0   ;sub %L4-10, set cc, discard result</TT>
<TT>or    %o3,0xFF,%o3 ;set lowest 8 bits of %o3 to 1's</TT>
<TT>xnor  %L6,%G0,%L6  ;complement %L6 (same as NOT in 680x0)</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Comparison of CISC vs. RISC (680x0 vs. SPARC)</H3>

<P>A RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) achieves the same functionality
with a much smaller (and more consistent) instruction set. For example,
the sets of instructions below can do roughly the same jobs. (Size modifiers
like &quot;ub&quot; after &quot;ld&quot; in SPARC and &quot;.w&quot; after
&quot;move&quot; in 680x0 are ignored.)</P>

<P>680x0:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>add,adda,addi,addq,clr,cmp,cmpa,cmpi,cmpm,exg,<BR>
  ext,extb,move,movea,move16,movem,moveq,neg,negx,<BR>
  sub,suba,aubi,subq,tst</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SPARC:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>ld,st,addcc,subcc</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>How is this reduction made possible?</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Three operands per instruction
  <LI>The fact that %g0 gives easy access to a 0 value
  <LI>The use of more instructions is expected in some cases. (Example,<BR>
  <TT>move (a3)+,-(a4)<BR>
  </TT>in 68000 would require<BR>
  <TT>ld [%L3],%G1<BR>
  add %L3,4,%L3<BR>
  sub %L4,4,%L4<BR>
  st %G1,[%L4]<BR>
  </TT>in SPARC.
  <LI>But, in the example above, both machines would likely use about the
  same number of clock cycles, and the SPARC would have a faster clock because
  it is simpler, so the SPARC would likely be faster for roughtly equivalent
  technology.
</UL>

<H3>CALL Instruction</H3>

<P>This instruction is used to call subprograms. As for the 680x0, we will
leave the details for later. For now, it will be used only to call library
routines.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>call printf</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3> Divide and Multiply</H3>
smul[cc] and umul[cc] are the unsigned multiplication and signed
multiplication instructions.  The operands are %r1,%r2,%r3  or
%r1,const13,%r3 where
the second 32 bit operand multiplies the first 32 bit operand and the 64
bit product is stored in %y:%r3.  %y is a special register for
multiplication and division. Only a few instructions can use it eg. MOV
%y,%L1.  The high order bits of the product are stored in %y and the low
order bits of
the product are stored in %r3.  The cc flags look only at %r3 and never at
%y.  No overflow is possible.  Example instruction - smul %L1,8,%L3
<BR><BR>
sdiv[cc] and udiv[cc] are signed division and unsigned division and
the operands are %r1,%r2,%r3 or %r1,const13,%r3.  The
second 32 bit operand divides the 64 bit operand %y:%r1 and puts the
64 bit answer into %y:%r3.  If %y is non-zero for after udiv, or if %y 
is not 32 bits equal to the sign bit, this is generally considered
to be overflow.  Because of this %y often contains junk.  Also the system
often uses %y (even before you run your program) and leaves junk there so
you must guard the division.  The easiest way to do that is move a 0 into
%y for udiv or use the following two instructions before sdiv.<br>
<pre>
    sra %L1,31,%g1
    mov %g1,%y
now %L1 is ready for any kind of division.
</pre>
The sra command moves the bits in %L1 31 places to the right padding the
leftof the register with sign bits.  The two instructions are the
equivalent of an extend
command in 68k.  We will learn more about shifts later.  Where is the
remainder?  Nowhere. You have to calculate it yourself.  So you must know
this formula for tests and exams: Remainder (when b divides a) := a-(b*(a
DIV b).  As before the cc flags are set only for %r3.  They do not use %y
at all.
   
<H3>SETHI Instruction (and the SET synthetic instruction)</H3>

<P>This instruction is one of the few that has a slightly different assembly-language
format. The syntax looks like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>sethi const22,%reg</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where &quot;const22&quot; is a 22-bit integer constant (signed or unsigned
is not relevant). It places the constant into the high-order 22 bits of
the register, and sets the low-order 10 bits of the register to 0's. (?!)
For example,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>sethi 0x333333,%L1; 0x333333 is 1100110011001100110011</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>would set register %L1 to</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>1100110011001100110011 0000000000</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Q: Why would you want to do this? A: In order to load a 32-bit constant
(such as an address) into a register. This can't possibly be done in one
instruction (since all instructions are 32 bits long, there isn't room for
a 32-bit constant and also an opcode and a register number). There are instructions
that can set the lower part of a register (add, or, etc), so this one complements
those nicely.</P>

<P>For example, to set %L1 to 0x89ABCDEF, do the following:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. Split up 0x89ABCDEF into the top 22 bits and the bottom 10 bits</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>89ABCDEF = 10001001101010111100110111101111
Top 22 bits are 1000100110101011110011 = 226AF3
Low 10 bits are 0111101111 = 1EF</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>2. Place the two halves into %L1 using separate instructions:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>sethi 0x226AF3,%L1
or    %L1,0x1EF,%L1 ;or is better than add. (WHY?)</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Shortcut #1: The SPARC assembler provides two special &quot;functions&quot;
to make this easier. %hi(X) will give the top 22 bits of the constant X
and %lo(X) will give the bottom 10 bits. This is an assembler feature. It
is not part of the SPARC machine language. So we could use</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>sethi %hi(0x89ABCDEF),%L1
or    %L1,%lo(0x89ABCDEF),%L1</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The most common use of this instruction is to place the address of something
into a register. For example, if there is a character string in memory with
the label &quot;Prompt&quot; on it, you can put the address of that string
into %o1 using</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>sethi %hi(Prompt),%o1
or    %o1,%lo(Prompt),%o1</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Shortcut #2: The above pair of instructions is used quite a lot, so the
assembler provides a &quot;synthetic instruction&quot; which will generate
them for you. The &quot;instruction&quot;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>set   const32,%reg</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>will accept any 32-bit constant (const32) such as an address, and any
register (%reg) and will generate</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>sethi %hi(const32),%reg
or    %reg,%lo(const32),%reg</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, it should be remembered that <B>SET is not a real SPARC instruction</B>,
and that <B>it produces two machine language instructions</B>, not one.
</P>

<BODY>

<H3>NOP Instruction (No OPeration)</H3>

<P>This is another &quot;synthetic instruction&quot;. The syntax looks like
this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>nop</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>but it really generates the instruction</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><TT>sethi 0,%g0</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>which does <B>absolutely nothing</B>. All instruction sets have a NOP
instruction. In RISC machines, it is often a very essential instruction.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SPARC Synthetic Instructions</H2>

<P>RISC machine languages do not have many instructions that are common
in CISC machine languages (move, negate, clear, compare, etc.) because all
of these can be done quite easily with 3-operand add, subtract, and logical
instructions. However, the assembler provides &quot;synthetic instructions&quot;
to improve convenience and readability. These are not real machine language
instructions, but the assembler will automatically translate them into the
proper instruction(s) for you.</P>

<P>In SPARC, some of the most common synthetic instructions are:</P>

<PRE>Synthetic Instruction   Assembled As
---------------------   -----------------------------
  clr     %reg          or      %g0,%g0,%reg
  cmp     %reg,%reg     subcc   %reg,%reg,%g0
  cmp     %reg,const    subcc   %reg,const,%g0
  mov     %reg,%reg     or      %g0,%reg,%reg
  mov     const,%reg    or      %g0,const,%reg

  set     const,%reg    sethi   %hi(const),%reg
                        or      %reg,%lo(const22),%reg</PRE>

<P>And here are some others that may be useful:</P>

<PRE>Synthetic Instruction   Assembled As
---------------------   -----------------------------
  clr     [address]     st      %g0,[address]
  clrh    [address]     sth     %g0,[address]
  clrb    [address]     stb     %g0,[address]
  dec     %reg          sub     %reg,1,%reg
  deccc   %reg          subcc   %reg,1,%reg
  inc     %reg          add     %reg,1,%reg
  inccc   %reg          addcc   %reg,1,%reg
  not     %reg          xnor    %reg,%g0,%reg
  neg     %reg          sub     %g0,%reg,%reg
  tst     %reg          orcc    %reg,%g0,%g0</PRE>

<P>Here are two that will be used for subprograms later:</P>

<PRE>Synthetic Instruction   Assembled As
---------------------   -----------------------------
  restore               restore %g0,%g0,%g0
  ret                   jmpl    %i7+8,%g0</PRE>
