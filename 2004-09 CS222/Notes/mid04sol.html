<h3>  General Section </h3>

<li>[6] Fill in the following table with the equivalent signed decimal
integers interpreted in the Number Representation specified at the top of
the column for the 8-bit binary numbers given in hexadecimal in the left
column . 

	<table border=2 cellpadding=6>
	<tr><th>Value</th><th>Signed Magnitude</th><th>Excess-128</th><th>1's complement</th><th>2'scomplement</th></tr>
	<tr><th>0C</th><td>12</td><td>-116</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr>
	<tr><th>00</th><td>0</td><td>-128</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><th>FE</th><td>-126</td><td>126</td><td>-1</td><td>-2</td></tr>
	</table>
<br>
<li>[4] Give 4 different reasons why two's complement is the "proper
choice" of general integer representation in a computer.
<pre>
1. Most efficient add algorithm
2. Best representation of zero
3. Easy sign extension
4. Self-inverting 
5. Fairly natural counting order
(need only 4 reasons)
</pre>

<li>[4] How is 8.25 stored in single precision using the IBM mainframe
standard. Write your answer as hex digits.  Show your work.
<pre>
8.25 = 8.4(16) = 0.84*16**(+1)

8=1000; .25*16=4.0

  0     100001            = 41
(sign) (-1 in excess 128)

8.25 is stored as 41840000

</pre>
<li> [1] In the IEEE standard for 32 bit storage of real numbers, how is
minus infinity stored.  Give the answer in hexadecimal digits.
<pre>

FF800000

</pre>
<li> [3] Write one or more lines of SPARC code to store
the contents of the low order byte of register %o0 in the memory location
whose address is 4 bytes higher than memory location with the symbolic
name "data".<br><br> 
<pre>
    set	  data,%L0        or 	set  data+4,%L0
    stub  %o0,[4+%L0]        	stub %o0,[%L0]

</pre>
<li> [3] Write one or more lines of 68k code to store the contents of the
low order byte of register D1 in the memory location whose address is 2
bytes higher than memory location with the symbolic name "data".<br><br> 
<pre>
   lea    data+2,a2    or     lea    data,a2
   move.b d1,(a2)             move.b d1,2(a2)

</pre>

<li> [3] What three types of things should not put into a delay slot.
<pre>
1. branch instruction
2. set	instruction
3. any instruction that has a dependency with the branch instruction 
</pre>


<li> [2] What are the two main differences between a RISC and a CISC
machine.  
<pre>
1. RISC has a reduced set of instructions whereas CISC has a complex set of 
instructions.
2. RISC has all instructions same length (or can be executed in 1 cycle
most of time) and CISC has variable length instructions (take different number
of cycles to execute).
3. RISC are pipelined whereas CISC usually are not.
( 2 of these are good enough.  The difference innumber of registers is due
to SPARC pecularity not the fact it is a RISC)
</pre>
 
<li> [4] 68k has two types of registers.  What are they and what is their
difference?
<pre>
The data registers are to hold data whereas the A registers hold
addresses.
</pre>

<li> [3] List three desirable attributes any collating sequence
(ie. algorithm to associate characters to binary sequences) should have.
Does ASCII have all 3 attributes?
<pre>

1) the digits are in consecutive order 0-9
2) the lowercase alphabet is consecutive order a-z
3) the uppercase alphabet is consecutive order A-Z
YES

</PRE>
<li> [2] Write code in 68k and Sparc to change an uppercase letter
stored in D1 or %L1 to a lower case letter.
<PRE>

sub %L0,'A'-'a',%L0       subi.b #'A'-'a',D1

</pre>
<LI>[3] In 68k, write code to calculate the quotient (do not worry
about the remainder when the signed integer in D1.w is divided by 8 using:<br>
 i) a shift command. 
ii) a divide command. <br>  
Which would be faster?
<pre>
lsr.w   #3,D1 faster

divs    #8,D1 slower
</pre>

<li> [2] Is it better to leave data in memory or try to store them, if
possible, in registers?  Why?
<pre>
It is better (ie faster) to leave data in registers because even though a
language may have instructions to do operations on data in memory, the
operation still has to be done in registers, anyways.  Of course in SPARC
every arithmetic/logical operation has to be done in the registers.
</pre>


<h3> Programming </h3>
<p> In the next two programming question, do not include an ID banner or
a normal termination section. Do not initalize the stack pointer, use the org
command, or initialize the DUART.   Inline comments are not required. You
do not need to optimize delay slots but do include the SPARC prologue and
SPARC epilogue.  You must include a register dictionary. Use good form
unless otherwise indicated.  You may assume that the 68kIO.s will be
included or you may assume that MASlib.c will be used with your program.
<p>
<li>[15] Write a 68k simulator program that gives one prompt for a list
of integers (positive and negative but not 0) and reads them from the
keyboard until it reads a sentinel  0. Your program should check to
see if these numbers are "proper" or not and print the designation underneath
the integer.  A number is "proper" as long as the square of the number is
divisible by 8. Your program should print out whether the number read in
is proper or not.  You may assume that the quotient will fit in 16 bits.

prop: 	dc.b   'Proper',lf,cr,null
prmpt   dc.b   lf,cr,'Type in a list of integers, 0 to quit',lf,cr,null



</pre>

<li> [15] Write a SPARC assembly language program to do the same as the
above question except that the input comes from a file and the output
goes to a different file. One other change is to print "proper" or "not
proper" beside the number.  Be sure to make all appropriate changes. 
You do not have to give any UNIX commands.
