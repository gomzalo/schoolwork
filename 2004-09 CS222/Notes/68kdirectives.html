<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Assembler Directives</H2>

<p><h4><b>Source Code Control</b></h4>
In most modern machines, the code and data must be stored separately.
This is not true of the simulator.  


<H4>2. Boundary Alignment</H4>


<p> In the simulator, use</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>DS.W   O</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<p> to produce the proper alignment when some code follows the data. The
"ORG  $1000" directive aligns the first chunk of code.  The template does 
both of these directives for you.  Since data is forced on the correct
boundary alignment, there is no need to use this directive with
data.  Normally, you don't see this directive much.

<H4>3. Storage Allocation</H4>

<P>To allocate uninitialized storage for variables, use</P>

<PRE>
   ds.b N ;allocate N bytes of uninitialized storage
   ds.w N ;allocate N words (2N bytes)
   ds.l N ;allocate N longwords (4N bytes)
</pre>


<P>To place particular initial values in memory (constants or initialized
variables) use</P>
<PRE>
   dc.b value,value,... ;Each value occupies 1 byte
   dc.w value,value,... ;Each value occupies 2 bytes
   dc.l value,value,... ;Each value occupies 4 bytes
   dc.b 'characters..'  ;Each ascii character occupies a byte
   dcb.b N,Value ;Allocate N bytes, all initialized to Value
   dcb.w N,Value ;Allocate N words, all initialized to Value
   dcb.l N,Value ;Allocate N longwords, all initialized to Value</PRE>
</PRE>


<p>
<H4>4. Symbol Definition</H4>

<P>In any assembler, symbols (identifiers) may be defined in two ways:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>By using a symbol as a label, it stands for the address into which
  the following code or data will be placed (the value of the &quot;location
  counter&quot;).  The label starts in column 1 and does not need a colon
  after it but it is not wrong to have one.  If the label is not in column
  1 then the colon is a terminator and must be there but it is not part of
  the label.
  
  <LI>By defining a symbol and giving it a value directly. In 68k use<BR>
  symbol  equ value<BR>
  where the &quot;value&quot; may be any constant, or any expression
  which combines constants to give a constant answer. </O
L>

<P>Example 1</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>ArraySize equ   10
TheArray  ds.w  ArraySize  allocate space for the array
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>
Four symbols are defined here. &quot;ArraySize&quot; has the value 10,
&quot;TheArray&quot; has as its value the address of a block of 10 words
in memory (which is also an integer value just like 10).


<P>Example 2
<Blockquote>
Heading   dc.b  'This is a longwinded heading full of junk...'
EndHeading
HdgLngth:  equ   EndHeading-Heading</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Heading&quot; has as its value the address of the first byte of a
string of characters in memory, and &quot;EndHeading&quot; has as its
value the address of the first byte after the last byte of the string of
characters in memory. So the value of &quot;HdgLngth&quot; is the length
of that string.  This last example is used if the output routine uses
length rather than terminators.  Our output routines use terminators.

<h2>Standard Library Routines</h2>
<h3>68K</h3>
To call a library routine use:
<pre>   jsr    name</pre>
<p>
Here is a descrition of the standard routines for the 68K.


<P><TABLE WIDTH="450" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0" HEIGHT=
"355">
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="24%" HEIGHT="17"><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;<B>Name</B></TD>
<TD WIDTH="76%"><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Purpose</B></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">NEWLINE</TD>
<TD>Write a newline command. (carriage control, linefeed)</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">DECIN</TD>
<TD>Read a signed long decimal integer from the keyboard into
d0.  Input terminated by a &lt;return&gt;.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">HEXIN</TD>
<TD>Read a long hexadecimal integer (up to 8 characters) from the keyboard
into d0.  Input terminated by a &lt;return&gt;.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">DECOUT</TD>
<TD>Write a signed decimal integer from D0.W to the screen using 
11 spaces.  Stays on same line after output.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="17">HEXOUT</TD>
<TD>8-digit long hex written to screen from d0.  Stays on same
line after input.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="30">STROUT</TD>
<TD>Up to 400 characters written to screen at the string whose address is
in A0 and null terminated</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="69">STRIN</TD>
<TD>Up to 400 character string of valid characters ($20 to $7E
inclusive) input from keyboard to memory location in a0. Input terminated
by a &lt;return&gt;.
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="30">CHROUT</TD>
<TD>Ascii character output to screen from d0</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="30">CHARIN</TD>
<TD>ascii character input from keyboard into d0</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="30">FINISH</TD>
<TD>terminates execution</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD HEIGHT="30">INITIO</TD>
<TD>initializes some bytes for Input/Output</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>The parameters (if any) are passed by placing them in registers D0
and/or A0 before the JSR statement is executed.  The result if any, is
returned in register D0 or A0.

The template has a description of each of the routines in it.
