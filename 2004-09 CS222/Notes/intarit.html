<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Integer Arithmetic</H2>

<P>Consider the two basic arithmetic operations (addition and negation,
from which subtraction can be derived easily) and how they would be performed
on signed integers using the four representations.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Negation</H3>

<H4>Signed Magnitude</H4>

<P>Just toggle the sign bit. Nothing simpler. If all you want to do is negate,
then this is the clear winner.</P>


<H4>Ones Complement</H4>

<P>Toggle all of the bits. This is a simple and fast operation. No bit depends
on any other bit, and so there are no carries, &quot;ripple&quot;, etc.</P>

<H4>Twos Complement</H4>

<P>Use the twos complement operation, i.e. toggle all bits and add 1. This
is a little bit slower than negating in ones complement or signed
magnitude numbers, but it can be implemented as efficiently as one's
complement with a relatively small amount of logic in today's computers.</P>

<H4>Excess-2^(N-1)</H4>

<P>Use the &quot;twos complement&quot; operation. (Since the only difference
between this representation and twos complement is that the sign bit is
inverted, this makes sense.) Excess-other-numbers do not work so simply,
however.</P>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Addition</H3>

<H4>Signed Magnitude</H4>

<P>This one is the worst. If the signs are the same, add the magnitudes
and use that same sign. If the signs differ, then you must determine which
one has the larger magnitude. The sign is the same as that one, and the
magnitude must be obtained by subtracting (not adding) the smaller one from
the larger one. (This is the way you do signed arithmetic by hand, but it's
not so good for digital logic.)</P>

<P>Examples:</P>

<PRE>-1 1001  larger (5) 101
+5 0101  smaller(1) 001
-- ----             ---
+4 ????   Subtract: 100 -&gt; add sign of larger -&gt; 0100

+1 0001  larger (5) 101
-5 0101  smaller(1) 001
-- ----             ---
-4 ????   Subtract: 100 -&gt; add sign of larger -&gt; 1100

+1 0001  
+5 0101  
-- ----  
+6 0110  Add. Leave the sign alone. 

-1 1001  
-5 1101  
-- ----  
-6 1110  Add. Leave the sign alone.</PRE>

<P>Either both a subtraction circuit and an addition circuit are needed,
or the subtraction could be done by twos complementing and then adding,
but in that case why not use twos complement in the first place??</P>

<H4>Excess-2^(N-1)</H4>

<P>The rule is this: Add the codes using normal binary addition, then <I>toggle
the sign bit</I>. Examples (using Excess-8):</P>

<PRE>-1 0111
+5 1101
-- ----
+4 0100 -&gt; toggle sign -&gt; 1100

+1 1001
-5 0011
-- ----
-4 1100 -&gt; toggle sign -&gt; 0100

+1 1001  
+5 1101  
-- ----  
+6 0110 -&gt; toggle sign -&gt; 1110

-1 0111  
-5 0011  
-- ----  
-6 1010 -&gt; toggle sign -&gt; 0010</PRE>

<P>Only an adder is required, but there is one (small) extra step involved.</P>

<H4>Ones Complement</H4>

<P>There's a tricky way to do this one: add the numbers, and then add the
carry coming out of the highest bit to the result (this was called an
&quot;end-around-carry&quot;).
Examples:</P>

<PRE>-1    1110
+5    0101
--    ----
+4 (1)0011 -&gt; 0011+1 = 0100

+1    0001
-5    1010
--    ----
-4 (0)1011 -&gt; 1011+0 = 1011

+1    0001  
+5    0101  
--    ----  
+6 (0)0110 -&gt; 0110+0 = 0110

-1    1110 
-5    1010
--    ----  
-6 (1)1000 -&gt; 1000+1 = 1001</PRE>

<P>Weird, isn't it? Again, only an adder is required but with an additional
step that could take a long time because it is really another complete
addition!</P>

<H4>Twos Complement</H4>

<P>Simply add the numbers. Period. (But ignore any carry out of the highest
bit.) This is the main reason why twos complement is now universally used.
Examples:</P>

<PRE>-1    1111
+5    0101
--    ----
+4 (1)0100

+1    0001
-5    1011
--    ----
-4 (0)1100

+1    0001  
+5    0101  
--    ----  
+6 (0)0110

-1    1111 
-5    1011
--    ----  
-6 (1)1010</PRE>

<P>Thus only a single addition is needed, with no extra steps. Also, the
same operation will add both signed and unsigned numbers. There is no
difference.  Also, overflow is easily detected (overflow has occurred if
the sign of the result is different from the signs of both operands. 
This is implemented as overflow occurs if the carry into the sign
bit is not equal to the carry going out og the sign bit).</P>

Subtraction</h4>
Negate then add
<h4 align=center>
Sign Extension:</h4>
Converting from one size of representation to a larger size.&nbsp; Eg 8
bits to 16 bits to 32 bits
<br>&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>
OC or TC: Fill new high-order bits with copies of sign bit.</li>

<li>
SM:&nbsp; insert 0 bits between sign bit and old&nbsp; bits.  The bit 
operations make this extremely slow.</li>

<li>
EN: insert opposite of sign bit between sign bit and old bits.  Again 
very slow.</li>

<li>
Unsigned: Just add 0's</li>
</ul>

<h4 align=center>
<br>
Two's Complement is the "proper choice</h4>

<ul>
<li> add algorithm is most efficient.  It is just plain binary - this 
can not get any simpler.  It works for both signed and unsigned.</li>

<li>
best representation of&nbsp; 0.  It is unique and natural.</li>

<li>
a good natural counting sequence and best sign extension</li>

<li>
self-inverting One algorithm does both positive and negative
algorithms</li>
</ul>

<h4 align=center>
Drawbacks </h4>
<ul><li>-2<sup>N-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup> is a special case (It
complements to itself) 
<li>
negation is somewhat slow</li>
</ul>

<h4 align=center>
Why so Good</h4>
<li>
equivalent to doing everything in mod 2<sup>n&nbsp; </sup>eg-1 = 15 mod
16 and 1111 is 15 in unsigned binary.</li>
</ul>

<h4 allign=center>
Carry/Borrow</h4>
This usually refers to the carry bit going out of the sign bit under
addition or the opposite of the carry bit under subtraction (ie. negation
and addition), except for 0 which never needs a borrow.  The carry bit is
called a borrow bit under subtraction. We will see more when we talk about
flags.

<h4 align=center> Use of Hexadecimal</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Used as a shorthand to avoid long, long sequences of 0/1's.</li>

<li>
To change a sequence of 0/1's of length 0 mod 4 which&nbsp; represents
an integer, partition the sequence from the right (lower order bit) and
translate:

<ul>
<li>
0000 to 0</li>

<li>
0001 to 1</li>

<li>
0010 to 2</li>

<li>
0011 to 3</li>

<li>
0100 to 4</li>

<li>
0101 to 5</li>

<li>
0110 to 6</li>

<li>
0111 to 7</li>

<li>
1000 to 8</li>

<li>
1001 to 9</li>

<li>
1010 to A</li>

<li>
1011 to B</li>

<li>
1100 to C</li>

<li>
1101 to D</li>

<li>
1110 to E</li>

<li>
1111 to F</li>
</ul>
<br>The left most hex bit will be 0-7 for positive numbers and 8-F for
negative numbers in OC or TC.
<br>

<li>
To find the value of&nbsp; a hex number in 2's complement</li>

<ul>
<li>
starting with 0-7 translate hex into 4 bit binary strings.</li>

<li>
starting with 8-F first you subtract hex number from FFF...F and add 1<br>

<b>OR </b><br>leave trailing 0's in hex&nbsp; # alone; subtract lowest
non-0
digit from (10)<sub>16</sub>; subtract other digits from F</li>
</ul>

then&nbsp; do the usual thing.</li>
</ul>
</dl>

<h4>
Example</h4>

<ol>
<li>
What is the value of the signed integer in TC in the 16 bit word in memory
which contains&nbsp; C8AO?</li>

<li>
What if it is an unsigned integer?</li>

<li>
What about a signed integer for 6C85?</li>

<li>
Unsigned?</li>
</ol>
