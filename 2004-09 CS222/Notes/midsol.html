	<li>Answer all questions on exam paper.
	<li>Last page is scrap.
	<li>Do not rip pages apart.
	<li>No aids or calculators are allowed.

<h3>  General Section </h3>

<li>[6] Fill in the following table with the 4-bit representations for the 
        signed decimal integers in the left column.  Give your answers as a 
        single hex digit.  You only need one correct answer per cell.

	<table border=2 cellpadding=6>
	<tr><th>Value</th><th>Signed magnitude</th><th>Excess-8</th><th>1's complement</th><th>2's complement</th></tr>
	<tr><th>7</th><td>7</td><td>f</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr>
	<tr><th>1</th><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><th>-5</th><td>d</td><td>3</td><td>a</td><td>b</td></tr>
	</table>

<li>[4] Explain why two's complement is the "proper choice" of integer
representation for general purposes in a computer.
<Pre>
1.Best addition algorithm working for all signed and unsigned integers  
2.Best zero representation, both unique and natural
3.Fairly natural counting sequence
4.Easy extension of sign
5.Self-inverting
</pre>
<li>[4] How is 16.5 stored in single precision using the IBM mainframe standard.
Write your answer as hex digits.
<pre>
16.5(10)=10.8(hex)=0.108*16**(2)
sign is 0 and exponent is 64+2=66=1000010(base 2)  which together is 
0100 0010 = 42.
Final answer is 42108000. 
</pre>
<p>

<li> [2] Describe the action of subcc %i0,%i1,%i2 .
<pre>
the contents of register %i1 is subtracted from the contents of %i0 and
the result put in %i2.  Also the cc flags are set.
</pre>
<p>
<li> [3] Write the following synthetic instructions using basic 3-operand
instructions.<br><br>
<pre>
a) CMP  %L1,3	   subcc  %L1,3,%g0
<br><BR>

<li> [2] Re-write (to the side) the following code without using a "nop".
<pre>
Loop:				Loop:	
   ....			          .... 		   
   add 		%L1,%L2,%L1	  subcc %L3,1,%L3	   
   subcc 	%L3,1,%L3         be    Loop		   
   be 		Loop	          add   %L1,%L2,%L1
   nop			 	Afterloop:	  
Afterloop:				
</pre>

<li> [2] Why is it impossible for a "set" command to successfully fill the
delay slot?
<pre>
It is two commands and will not fit in a one command delay slot
</pre>

<li> [1] What do the initials CISC stand for? 
Complex Instruction Set Computer
 
<li> [1] What does an assembler do?
<pre>
It translates assembly language code to machine language code
</pre>

<li> [3] There are three standard ways of associating characters to binary
sequences (i.e. collating sequences).  List all three.
<pre>
ASCII  EBCDIC UNICODE
</pre>
<li> [3] Write code in 68k and Sparc to change the character '3' stored in
register d1 or %L1 to the integer decimal 3.
<pre>
subi.b  #'0',d1           sub  %L1,'0',%L1
</pre>
<LI> [2] Change the sign of the following decimal integer stored in two's
complement as 00FF1000<sub>16</sub>.
<pre>
00FF1000 -> FF00EFFF + 1 -> FF00F000
<LI> [2] Is it better to leave data in memory or try to store them, if
possible, in registers?  Why?
<pre> 
It is better to leave them in registers as it takes extra time to obtain
the data from memory which must happen if they are involved in
calculations.
</pre>

<h3> Programming </h3>
<p> In the next two programming question, do not include an ID banner or
a normal
termination section. Do not initalize the stack pointer, use the org
command, or initialize the DUART.   Inline comments are not required. You
do not need to optimize delay slots but do include the Sparc prologue and
Sparc epilogue.  You must include a register dictionary. Use good form
unless otherwise indicated.  You may assume that the 68kIO.s will be
included or you may assume that MASlib.c will be used with your program.
<p>
<li>[13] Write a 68k simulator program to prompt for and read in a lead
value, n, from the keyboard and then (without further prompting) read in n
positive integers from the keyboard.  Your program should check to see if
these integers are valid pin numbers and print out to the creen whether
the number is  "valid" or "not valid" underneath them.  Use blank lines
appropriately.  A number is a valid pin number if its last digit is a five.
<pre>
*read a lead value, n, and n integers.  Print out if valid or non-valid
*below it. A number is valid if its last digit is 5
*a0,d0 for IO
*d1 counter starting at n
*d2 holds integer

main:
	lea 	prompt,a0
	jsr 	strout
	jsr	decin
	move.w  d0,d1
	bra 	checklp
loop:
	lea	title,a0
	jsr	strout
	jsr	decin
	move.l	d0,d2	
	divu	#10,d2
	swap	d2
	cmpi.w	#5,d2
	beq	valid
notvalid:
	lea	head1,a0
	jsr	strout
valid:
	lea	head2,a0
	jsr	strout
	jsr	newline
	jsr	newline
checklp:
	dbra	d1,loop
	break
prompt: dc.b	'How many integers are there, and please type them in',lf,cr,null
title:	dc.b	'The Integers',cr,lf,null
head1:  dc.b	'NOT ',null
head2:  dc.b    'VALID',null		

        include   68kIO.s             Input/Output routines
        end


</pre>

<li> [13] Write a SPARC assembly language program to do the same as the
above question except that the input comes from a file and the
output goes to a different file.  You do not have to give any UNIX
commands.
<pre>

!This program reads a lead value n (n >= 1) and n data values.

!Register Dictionary
! %o0 used for IO
! %L0 holds number
! %L5 is a counter contolling loop sarting with the lead value
