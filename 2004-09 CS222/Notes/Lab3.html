<h3>Week of 23-27 Feb. 2004 </h3>
                          

             
<p> In this lab you will be introduced to the environment for assembly language
programming for the Motorola 68000. We will write and assemble our programs in 
<tt>UNIX</tt> and <i>simulate</i> their execution with a program called 
<tt>BSVC</tt>.      
                  
<p> You may edit your 68000 assembly language programs using a text editor 
 such as <tt>pico</tt>, or you may use an editor such as <tt>nedit</tt> in 
<tt>X-Windows</tt>. Assembling your programs  is done from  the command line 
using the command <tt>68kasm</tt>. The  <tt>BSVC</tt> simulator is an
<tt>X-Windows</tt> program, so you <b>must</b> be working in
<tt>X-windows</tt> when running your 68000 programs. It is possible to
run an <tt>X-Windows</tt> terminal through any web browser using a program
called <tt>vnc</tt>; see the documentation about <tt>vnc</tt> in the
<tt>Documents</tt> page of the 222 web site. This means you can run
<tt>X-Windows</tt> from home, although they say it is slow. 
     </p>
                  
<h3>Task 1: Assembling and running a program</h3>
              
<ol>
<li>Logon to INS.  Gooid luck!

<li>Select <tt>INS Programs-&gt;Internet -&gt;Utilities-&gt;X-Win32 
 5.3</tt> to start an <tt>X-Windows</tt> terminal. Sign on using your
UNIX id and password and after the <tt>X-Windows</tt> has finished
initializing, choose from the menus at the botton of the screen (third
left arrow)    <tt>Hosts-&gt;This Host</tt> to get a window that accepts
<tt>UNIX</tt> commands.<br>
    
<li>Create a directory called <tt>Lab3</tt>. Copy the file
<tt>BSVC.setup</tt> from the <tt>Programs</tt> page of the 222 web
site. Use the techniques developed in labs 1 and 2.  This file is a text
file, but it contains a very long line that must not get broken in transit.
Some editors will transfer it correctly, but some will not. Use
<tt>ftp</tt> if you have trouble or put the line back together very
carefully checking with someone else's successfully transmitted line.
<li>Transfer the two files <tt>68kIO.s</tt> and <tt>68kAplusB.s</tt>
to the directory <tt>Lab3</tt>. The <tt>68kIO.s</tt> file contains Input/Output
routines that have names and functions very similar to what you have
been using on the <tt>SPARC</tt>. You will be "including" this file
in each program you write. Edit the program file <tt>68kAplusB.s</tt>
so the identification comments at the top contain your information. Go
to the bottom of the file and edit the strings that will be used to print 
a banner so that they also contain  your information. Note that <tt>null</tt> 
at the end of a character string terminates it and it must be there.   
 
<li> Return to the top of the file. The first section of
instructions, labelled <tt>setup low memory</tt>, is used to load two
important addresses into memory. The stack pointer is loaded into memory
address 0 and the starting address of your program is loaded into memory
address 4. The simulator will  use addresses when you choose
<tt>reset</tt>.   The section labelled <tt>equ symbols</tt> sets up
symbolic constants used for printing strings. Start your program below
the line that reads <tt>your program starts here</tt>. Program execution
starts at the label <tt>start</tt>,  which you also see being used in the
above <tt>setup low memory</tt>. The first action of your program will
generally be <tt>jsr initIO</tt>, which initializes the
simulator's I/O bits. At the end of the data section you see the        
<tt>include</tt> directive. This is not an executable instruction, but 
rather causes the assembler to include the contents of the named file at that
point in this program. We are using it here to include the I/O routines  
 after our program.&nbsp;Save your edited file as <tt>template.s</tt>.   
 
<li>Assemble your template program with the <tt>UNIX</tt>
command: <tt>68kasm    -l template.s</tt>. It produces as output the executable
version of your    program in a file called <tt>template.h68</tt>. The
<tt>-l</tt> option produces   a  listing file called <tt>template.lis</tt>.
Use an editor  to have a look   at the listing file. On the left-hand side
you will see two columns of hexadecimal    numbers, and on the right-hand
side you will see your assembly language  program.  The first column of numbers
gives  addresses and the second  column gives  the contents stored at those
addresses. The contents in  memory line up with  the assembly language code
that generated those contents.   At memory address 4, you should see the
contents 00001000 stored. This  corresponds to storing  the symbolic address
<i>start</i>. Scroll down through  the listing to the bottom where the
directive <tt>include 68kIO.s</tt> was.  There you should see the IO routines.
 
<li>In an <tt>X-Windows</tt> terminal, start the simulator 
with the command <tt>bsvc&amp;</tt>. (The <tt>&amp;</tt> is optional;
it makes the simulator run in background so you can issue other <tt>UNIX</tt>
commands while the simulator is active. You will find this useful when
you want to correct a program, assemble it, and run it again without having
to restart <tt>bsvc</tt>).  A  window titled <tt>BSVC: Version 2.1</tt>
will  appear. Under its <tt>File</tt> menu, choose <tt>Open Setup</tt>
<i><tt>.</tt>..</i> and open the <tt>BSVC.setup</tt> file saved previously. 
A window titled <tt>M68681  Port A</tt> will open.    This is the window that 
will be used for I/O when our program in running.  You may wish to
move these last two windows around so that both can be viewed
simultaneously.  Under the <tt>File</tt> menu
again, choose <tt>Load Program<i>...</i></tt> and load the executable file
<tt>template.h68</tt>. To run your program, first press the <tt>Reset</tt>
button, then the <tt>Run</tt> button. The I/O window will accept your
typing (if you click on it) and will display the output. The I/O is also
written to a file called <tt>68kout.txt</tt>.
Run the program several times with different inputs. Open <tt>68kout.txt</tt>
in a text editor. You will notice that the output from <i>all</i> the runs
of the program is in this file, not just the latest run. This means that
once you have your program working properly and you want to print the output
for handing in, delete this file and run the program one more time.  

<li> Open <tt>template.s</tt> in your text editor and save a copy as     
<tt>68kAminusB.s</tt>.  Find the <tt>add</tt> instruction and change
it to a subtract instruction <tt>sub</tt>.   Change the string 
that is printed with the answer so that it reads <tt>A - B =</tt> as well. 
Save the program. Assemble it and use the simulator to run  it.  Why does 
this not work? Ask your lab demonstrator to explain if you cannot figure 
it out.

<li>Print the <tt>68kout.txt</tt> file for the
<tt>68kAminusB.s</tt> &nbsp;program.<br>
           
<li> When you are finished running the bsvc simulator, choose
<tt>Quit</tt> from the <tt>File</tt> menu of the window <tt>BSVC:
Version   2.1</tt>.  
             
</ol>
Show the demonstrator your printout for the&nbsp;<tt>68kAminusB.s</tt> 
so you can be checked  off for task 1.<br>
         


<h3>Task 2: Using data files for input</h3>
The BSVC simulator does not have the capability to permit your programs to 
read input from files. However, the <tt>include</tt> statement
can be used to include data definition statements contained in a file.
It certainly doesn't work as well as redirection, since your program
must be edited and re-assembled for each data file you want to run, but
it gives  us a way to run a program with prepared data. Another restrictive 
aspect of using the <tt>include</tt> directive for including data files 
is that you have to use the same labels in your program that are used in 
the data file. The following  exercise will give you some practise with including 
data files in your programs.                 

<ol>
<li> Download the following files into your directory <tt>Lab3</tt>: 
  
    <ul>
        <li><tt><a href="AplusBData.s">AplusBData.s</a></tt>, a version of the 
            "A plus B" program that uses a data file.</li>
        <li><tt><a href="AplusBdat1.txt">   AplusBdat1.txt</a></tt>     
             and <tt><a href="AplusBdat2.txt">AplusBdat2.txt</a></tt>, two
different data files. </li>
   
    </ul>

<li> Have a look at the data files first. They each contain two lines, which  
hold values for A and B. The data values are defined using assembler memory 
directives, just like you would use in your program.  The lines have labels 
<tt>AInput</tt> and <tt>BInput</tt>, respectively.    

<li> Now take a look at <tt>AplusBData.s</tt>. You will notice that the data 
is not read from the keyboard. Instead, the data is contained in memory, and  
is loaded from memory locations labeled AInput and BInput.  Go to the bottom   
of the program, and you will see the include statement: 
<pre>	include   AplusBdat1.txt</pre>
This copies the contents of the first data file into the program when it is 
assembled. Assemble the program and run it.   

<li> Now edit&nbsp;<tt>AplusBData.s</tt> and change the <tt>include</tt> 
statement so that it includes the other data file, <tt>AplusBdat2.txt</tt>. 
Assemble and run the program.  You will notice that the input values and
the result have changed.  

<li> Now edit&nbsp;<tt>AplusBData.s</tt> and change the <tt>APrompt</tt>
and <tt>BPrompt</tt> to <tt>AHead</tt>  and  <tt>BHead</tt> respectively.
These are no longer prompts but headings and should be changed throughout
the program.
         
<li>Run the program again.<br>
         
             
</ol>
Show the demonstrator your printout of the source and the output for the
final   run of <tt>AplusBData.s</tt> so you can be checked  off for task 2.<br>
       
<h3>Controlling <tt>68kout.txt</tt></h3>
        
<p>To get around the problem of <tt>68kout.txt</tt> getting so large that
your quota is used up, create a shell script as follows.            
                       </p>
      
<ol>
             <li>Create and edit a file called <tt>mybsvc</tt>. For example,
type <tt>pico mybsvc</tt>. </li>
             <li>Type in the next three lines exactly as is:            
                                                                        
        
    <pre>#!/bin/csh<br>rm 68kout.txt<br>bsvc&amp;<br></pre>
                  
<li>Note, <tt>UNIX</tt> requires a <tt>&lt;return&gt;</tt> before it
looks at any  command, so each of the above 3 lines <b>must</b> be terminated 
with a <tt>&lt;return&gt;</tt>.  In your editor, it will probably look like 
you have 4 lines in the file. Save the file.<br>
      
<li>Now you have to make <tt>mybsvc</tt> executable. Type: 
<tt>chmod u+x mybsvc</tt>; this adds the "executable" permission to the
file <tt>mybsvc</tt>.
       
<li>To run <tt>bsvc</tt>, instead of typing the command <tt>bsvc</tt>, you can 
type <tt>mybsvc</tt>, and above commands will be excecuted. If 
<tt>68kout.txt</tt> exists you will be prompted to see if you want to delete 
it and then <tt>bsvc</tt> is invoked.  If <tt>68kout.txt</tt> is not there, 
<tt>UNIX</tt> says so and envokes <tt>bsvc</tt> immediately.
