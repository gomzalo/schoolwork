<p>In this lab, we will modify programs that contain code to do a bubble sort
of an array of byte values so that the bubble sort code is in a subroutine. 
  Create a directory called Lab5 and download the two programs <a
 href="SparcBubble.s">SparcBubble.s</a> and <a href="68kBubble.s">68kBubble.s</a>.<br>
     </p>
     
<h3>Task 1: <tt>SPARC</tt> subroutine </h3>
        
<p> Our <tt>SPARC</tt> subprograms will use registers for passing arguments
    and returning  results.  At any point in a program, the programmer has
 access  to 32 registers.  The 8 <tt>global</tt> registers are truely globals;
their contents  are accessible  to all subroutines. The  other 24 registers,
the <tt>in</tt>,  <tt>local</tt><i>,</i> and <tt>out</tt> registers, are
mapped into a larger <i>register set</i>,  typically consisting of 128 registers.
 The <tt>save</tt> instruction changes  the register mapping so that a new
 set of <tt>local</tt> and <tt>out</tt> registers are provided. The <tt>out</tt>
registers before the <tt>save</tt> instruction become the <tt>in</tt> registers
 after the <tt>save</tt> instruction.  We use these overlapping registers
to pass parameters and return results.  Registers <tt>%o0</tt> to <tt>%o5</tt>
can be used to pass up to 6 parameters  to a subroutine and to return up
to  6 results. Register <tt>%o6</tt> is the stack pointer and register <tt>%o7</tt>
is used to store the return address  from a  subroutine call.  </p>
        
<p> For example, look at the calls to the <tt>printarr</tt> subroutine in 
  <tt>SparcBubble.s</tt>. Parameters   are placed in registers <tt>%o0</tt> 
and <tt>%o1</tt> before the subroutine  call. Now look at the subroutine itself.
The first instruction is the <tt>save</tt> instruction. This instruction is
a special add instruction which, in addition  to changing the register mapping,
allocates 96 bytes of space on the stack. After the <tt>save</tt> instruction,
the <tt>out</tt> registers become the <tt>in</tt> registers, and we can get
our input parameters from  registers <tt>%i0</tt> and <tt>%i1</tt>. The <tt>restore</tt>
instruction at  the end of the subroutine restores the register mapping back
to the original  register set. </p>
         
<p> The <tt>call</tt> and <tt>ret</tt> instructions provide the mechanism
    for a call to a  subroutine to return to the correct location. Both are
  branch  instructions, so they both have delay slots to keep in mind. Typically
  the  delay slot of the <tt>ret</tt> instruction is filled with the <tt>restore</tt>
instruction. The <tt>call</tt> instruction stores its own address in register
    <tt>%o7</tt>. Of course, the correct location to continue execution after 
    the return from the subroutine is the instruction after the delay slot. 
   So, the <tt>ret</tt> instruction actually branches to the address <tt>%i7+8</tt>. 
   </p>
           
<h3>Making a <tt>SPARC</tt> Subroutine</h3>
          Change the bubble sort code in <tt>SparcBubble.s</tt>&nbsp;into 
a  subroutine  by following the steps outlined below.         
<ol>
          <li> Add two instructions to place the input parameters for the 
bubble    sort in registers <tt>%o0</tt> and <tt>%o1</tt>. The parameters 
are the  same  as the ones for the <tt>printarr</tt>  subroutine. Place these 
instructions    just before the code for the bubble sort. Add the instruction 
    <tt>call bubble</tt> below these two lines. Don't forget about the delay 
slot for the <tt>call</tt> instruction. </li>
          <li> Use Cut and Paste to move the code for the bubble sort below 
 the       <tt>printarr</tt> subroutine. Add a comment block at the beginning 
 of   the bubble sort code.  </li>
          <li> Note the <tt>.section ".text"</tt>, <tt>.global</tt>, and
    <tt>.align</tt> pseudo-ops at the beginning  of the <tt>printarr</tt>
subroutine. Add these   to your new subroutine, changing  the label of the
 <tt>.global</tt> pseudo-op   to <tt>bubble</tt>, of course.  Add the <tt>save</tt>
instruction after the  pseudo-ops. This should be the  first instruction
executed in your subroutine,   so put the label <tt>bubble</tt> just before,
or on, this instruction.   </li>
          <li> Add the <tt>ret</tt> and <tt>restore</tt> instructions to
the   end   of the subroutine. </li>
          <li> Find the instructions that obtain the two input parameters 
directly    and change them or replace them so that they obtain their values 
from registers       <tt>%i0</tt> and <tt>%i1</tt>.</li>
       <li>Put two calls in the main program so you now sort <tt>array1</tt>
and     <tt>array2</tt>, and of course print each array before and after each
call to sort. The original main program sorted only <tt>array1</tt>.<br>
       </li>
          <li> Assemble and run your program. </li>
        
</ol>
                   Show the demonstrator your program and its output so you 
 can  be checked    off for task 1.<br>
                
<h3>Task 2: 68000 subroutine&nbsp;</h3>
See the document about 68000 Subroutine Linkage on the Documents page of
the web site for more information about the conventions that we will be using.<br>
        
<ol>
          <li>The subroutine convention for this course is that all parameter 
  passing   will be done via the stack.  You will note that the subroutines 
  in <tt>68kIO.s</tt> does not follow this convention.  That is because they 
  were written to simulate  system routines that break all the rules.  We 
will  obey the rules! </li>
                <li> Look at the program <tt>68kBubble.s</tt>. This program 
 has one subroutine already  implemented, which prints   the array elements. 
  Let us examine how we invoke a subroutine.  Look at  the mainline to the
  code under the comment "Print the unsorted array."  The  first two commands
  print out a title.                                         
    <pre>   lea     array1,a0<br>   move.l  a0,-(sp)<br></pre>
         puts the address of the array on the stack; the address of the array
is a parameter     needed by the subroutine.  Now the stack grows from high
addresses to low    addresses and the stack pointer <tt>sp</tt> points to
the last item put   on the stack so we must decrement the <tt>sp</tt> before
placing stuff on   the stack.  The next command places the second parameter,
the size of the   array, on the stack.  The command                     
                   
    <pre>   jsr    printarr<br></pre>
         places its address on the stack, and cause <tt>printarr</tt>'s address 
   to be placed  in the PC so that it will be the next instruction to be executed.
    Eventually,                                         
    <pre>   adda.l #6,sp <br></pre>
         "pops" the parameters off the stack.  Actually it just points the
 stack    pointer to where it was before and the parameters are left on the
 stack.  There is another call to printarr after the bubble sort code and
after the  comment "Print the sorted array". </li>
          <li> Let us examine the subroutine <tt>printarr</tt> itself. The
 name  of the subroutine  is simply a label which appears before the first
 instruction  of the subroutine   code. The code itself is a simple: it uses
 a "for loop"  to process all the  elements in the array. The only additional
 instructions   are the     <tt>movem</tt> instruction, the <tt>rts</tt>
instruction  and  the two instructions  involving the stack pointer<tt></tt>.
  </li>
          <li>The <tt>movem</tt> (move multiple) instruction is used to save
  the  contents of registers on the stack and to restore the saved values
from  the  stack to the registers. A subroutine will need to use registers
as work  variables,  but it should not destroy the values those registers
held when  the subroutine  is called. The <tt>movem</tt> instruction at the
beginning  of the subroutine  pushes the register values onto the stack.
 The <tt>movem</tt> instruction  near the end of the subroutine pops the
saved values from the  stack and puts  them back into the registers. These
instructions both have  an identical <i>register  list</i>, which specifies
the registers to be saved  and the order in which  they are saved. A range
of registers is designated  with a dash (e.g. <tt>d0-d3</tt> means <tt>d0</tt>,
    <tt>d1</tt>, <tt>d2</tt> and     <tt>d3</tt>), while individual  registers
are separated with a slash  (e.g. <tt>d0/d3</tt>  means <tt>d0</tt> and <tt>d3</tt>).<br>
         The register values are pushed onto the stack using predecrement 
addressing  mode. This works because that the stack grows towards lower memory 
 addresses.  The second <tt>movem</tt> instruction is a kind of mirror image 
 of the first.  It uses postincrement mode to "pop" register values from the
 stack, and the register list now becomes the destination operand, rather 
than the  source.<br>
    By the way, if you are writing a  function, then you need to return a 
value  in <tt>d0</tt> or <tt>a0</tt>. In this case you should not restore 
    <tt>d0</tt> or <tt>a0</tt> to its previous  value. </li>
          <li> The two other instructions involving the stack pointer, take 
 the   parameters of the subroutine off the stack without moving the stack 
 pointer.    This is the standard way to get subroutine parameters in all 
assembly languages   except <tt>SPARC</tt>.  The tricky part is calculating 
the offsets.  Notice  that in the stack frame in the opening comments for 
the subroutine.  We carefully calculate how many bytes are used to store stuff
on the stack during the subroutine linkage stage. The last thing stored (top
of the stack) are 4 registers of 4 bytes each.  They start with offset 0.
 The second last thing stored (at offset 16) is the return address of 4 bytes.
 The third last thing stored (at offset 20) is two bytes for the array length
and the fourth last thing stored(at offset 22) is 4 bytes for the array address.
 Note that the return address and parameters are pushed onto the stack in
the calling routine (in this case the mainline).  </li>
          <li> The <tt>rts</tt> (return from subroutine) instruction also 
uses   the stack. It is the last instruction in a subroutine. It "pops" the 
return   address  off the stack and loads it into the program counter (PC). 
Program   execution  then proceeds at the instruction following the call to
the subroutine.    </li>
        
</ol>
         
<h3>Making a 68K subroutine</h3>
         
<p> We will now convert the code that performs the bubble sort into a subroutine.
    The steps for this conversion are outlined below.  </p>
        
<ol>
          <li> Identify the <i>parameters</i> for the subroutine. This includes 
   both input and output parameters. The parameters for the bubble sort are 
  identical  to the parameters for the <tt>printarr</tt> subroutine, namely 
  the address of the array and the number of elements. Create three instructions 
  to push the parameters onto the stack. Put these lines just before the code
  that performs the bubble sort. </li>
          <li> Just below the three lines you have added, add a fourth line 
 that   will  call your new subroutine using the&nbsp;<tt></tt> <tt>jsr</tt><i></i> 
instruction. This instruction requires a single argument, which is a label 
   that appears before the first instruction of the subroutine code. In this 
   case, you can use <tt>jsr bubble</tt>.    </li>
          <li> Add a fifth line that pops the parameters off the stack when 
 the   mainline  resumes executing. </li>
          <li> Use Cut and Paste to move the code for the bubble sort below 
 the   printarr  subroutine. Add a comment header for your new routine similar 
 to  the one for printarr. Particularly important is the register dictionary 
 and  stack frame. Examine the bubble sort code carefully and note all the 
 registers  it uses These are the registers you will need to save and restore 
 using the      <tt>movem</tt> instruction. Add the two <tt>movem</tt> instructions 
  to  the beginning and end of the bubble sort code.  This changes the stack 
  frame; you now have to space over the saved registers to get at your parameters.
(In a later assignment, we will use the <tt>link</tt> and <tt>unlk</tt> instructions
to eliminate this extra adjustment.) </li>
          <li> The last statement in the bubble sort subroutine is the <tt>rts</tt><i></i> 
instruction, so add this at the end of the subroutine. </li>
          <li> You aren't quite done yet. You still have to change two instructions
    so that you get the two parameters, address and size of array, from the
  stack.</li>
      <li>Put two calls in the main program so you now sort <tt>array1</tt> 
and      <tt>array2</tt>, and of course print each array before and after 
each call to sort. The original main program sorted only <tt>array1</tt>.<br>
      </li>
          <li> Assemble and test your new subroutine. </li>
        
</ol>
           Show the demonstrator your program<tt></tt> and its output so
you   can  be checked   off  for task 2.<br>
