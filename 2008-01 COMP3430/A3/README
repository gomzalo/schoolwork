-----------------------

Works like a charm and gives the same output as wc. I saved output in 
out.txt, but running the program is surely more interesting.
All necessary files are included in the directory.

To compile:
  gcc produce_consume.c -o produce_consume -lpthread

To run:
  produce_consume <num_threads> subject.txt
Where <num_threads> is a value between 1 - 10 denoting the number of 
consumer threads you want running.

Also note that the second argument (subject.txt) can be any file 
containing text; I figured you would be using subject.txt, however.

Happy marking!
