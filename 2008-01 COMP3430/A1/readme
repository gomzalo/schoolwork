COMP3430 Assignment 1 - Question 4
Trevor Bekolay, 6796723

To compile my shell program, you just need to do typical gcc command:
  gcc shell.c -o shell

Running it is similarly straightforward;
  shell

If you'd like to run the sample commands, navigate to the test directory 
and redirect cmd.dat to the shell program.
  cd test
  shell < cmd.dat

Note that my answers to questions 1-3 are located in the A1_Q1-3.pdf file 
in the current directory.

Happy marking!
