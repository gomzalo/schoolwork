COMP3430 Assignment 2

Greetings! Program works well and gives good data. I was considering an optimization in which the thread 
would cache the number of found/not_found and only update the shared variable at the end of the method, 
but it makes more sense to have the methods slow to more clearly show the disparity between the mutex and 
read/write solutions.

Also note that I have done 20 writes, defined as NUMWRITES in 
a2parameters.h. There were never any explicit instructions on how many 
values to write into the list, so I just chose 20 arbitrarily.

To compile:
  gcc -o mutex main_mutex.c concurrentList.c -lpthread
  gcc -o rw main_rw.c concurrentRWList.c -lpthread

To run:
  mutex
  rw

Note that mutex can take upwards of five minutes to run, so put on a pot of coffee!
