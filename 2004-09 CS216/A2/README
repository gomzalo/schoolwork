Question 1:
Relatively straightforward, compile normally with "gcc palindrome.c" (with 
specified output if you're adventurous).  The main "driver" class just 
tests some palindromes I made up all by myself, and covers most of the 
weird cases, though there aren't many to check.  If the palindrome class 
is working correctly, you won't see any "Error!" messages.

Question 2:
Again, straightforward to compile, just "gcc thecount.c".  The program 
will accept input from stdin, echo it, give a message about the number of 
"the"s on every line of input, as well as a total number of "the"s once 
the EOF is reached (or ^D is typed if inputting text manually).
